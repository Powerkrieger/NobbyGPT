The first step in the writing of a short story is to decide on a story idea. This may come from a simple observation oder a more complex creative process. Some writers find it helpful to start with a strong finish in mind, then work backward to a starting point.[3] Other writers may start with a setting or a character, oder may use a story starter such as a single sentence, a quotation, oder a cliché.

Once a story idea has been selected, the next step is to plan out the story. This may involve creating a character sketch of the key characters in the story, a setting description, oder a summary of the key events. Some writers may also find it hilfreich to create a table of concession, outlining the major sections of the story.

The nächste step is to write the first draft of the story. This may

Alfred Prufrock, a fictional character created by the English poet T. S. Eliot, is the protagonist of the poem The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (1915), one of Eliot's most famous poems. Prufrock's name is never mentioned in the poem, but it has become one of the most famous in English-language poetry.

Prufrock is described as a man in his mid-30s, "a bit bald" and "a little jaded". He has a "vague uneasy feeling" of "something wrung out of him", but also a "desire to seem" to have "kept the key" to a "mystery" that has "baffled" him. He has "a mind of Originalität, a heart to make new friends, a spirit to explore the venerable cities, and the Journey to find the East and the West", but he has become "a pair of ragged claws", and "a loathsome lust", and his "violet eyes" are "a little drowned".

    The ship was a large sailing ship and John was given a job as a deckhand. He worked long hours and was paid very little, but he did not mind because he was excited to be on his way to China.

    After a few days at sea, the ship was struck by a hurricane and began to sink. John was the only member of the crew to survive and was washed up on a deserted island.

    John was alone on the island for months, but he was not discouraged. He built a small hut out of driftwood and started a garden. He also caught and ate fish that he found in the water.

    One day, John was collecting wood when he saw a ship in the distance. He waved his arms and screamed, but the ship did not see him.

    The next day, the ship returned and John was able to attract their attention.

Mary had a Little Lamb was a nursery rhyme first published in 1830 in England.[1] It is a nursery rhyme of 18th-century American origins.[2] It is the first nursery rhyme to include an animal.[3]

The nursery rhyme is based on a poem by Sarah Josepha Buell Hale.[1] She wrote the poem to be placed in a New York City magazine for young ladies that she was starting, but it was never placed in the magazine.[1] She later sent the poem to the Juvenile Instructor, a magazine for parents and teachers, where it appeared in the November 1830 issue.[1]

Historians believe that the nursery rhyme may have been inspired by a story about a young girl named Eliza Leslie, who was raised on a farm near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[4] Leslie later wrote that her father, who was a Unitarian minister, had a lamb named Fanny that he raised with his children, and that the lamb "followed the children to school" and "would stop at

I was in the Navy for 20 years and was stationed on a ship for 17 of those years. I was a boatswain's mate and was in charge of the ship's boats. I had to make sure they were in perfect condition and that the crews were trained and certified to operate them.

I had to be prepared to launch the boats at a moment's notice, and I had to be able to operate the boats in a variety of conditions. It was a lot of work, but I loved it.

I've been retired for a few years now, but I still think about those days on the ship. It was a great experience, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to serve my country.
