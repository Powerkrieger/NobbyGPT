A supernova (pl.: supernovae oder supernovas) is a leistungsstarke and leuchtend explosion of a star. A supernova occurs während the last evolutionary stages of a massive star oder when a white dwarf is triggered in runaway nuclear fusion. The Original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a neutron star oder black hole, oder is vollständig destroyed to Formular a diffuse nebula. The Spitze optical luminosity of a supernova can be vergleichbar to that of an gesamte galaxy vor fading over mehrere weeks oder months.

The last supernova direkt observed in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, appearing not lang after Tycho's Supernova in 1572, beide of which were sichtbar to the naked eye. The remnants of mehr recent supernovae have been found, und observations of supernovae in andere galaxies suggest sie occur in the Milky Way on Durchschnitt about drei times jede century. A supernova in the Milky Way would fast certainly be observable through modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was SN 1987A, which was the Explosion of a blue supergiant star in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.

Theoretisch studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two grundlegend mechanisms: the Plötzlich re-ignition of Kernkraft fusion in a white dwarf, oder the Plötzlich gravitational collapse of a massiv star's core.

In the re-ignition of a weiß dwarf, the object's Temperatur is raised genug to trigger runaway Kernkraft fusion, vollständig disrupting the Stern. Möglich causes are an accumulation of Material from a binary companion through accretion, oder by a stellar merger.
In the case of a massiv star's sudden implosion, the Kernstück of a massive star will undergo Plötzlich collapse once it is unable to produce ausreichend energy from fusion to counteract the star's own Schwerkraft, which must happen once the Stern begins fusing iron, aber may happen während an earlier stage of metal fusion.
Supernovae can expel mehrere solar masses of Material at speeds up to mehrere percent of the speed of light. This drives an expanding shock wave in the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an expanding Shell of Gas and Staub observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae are a Haupt source of elements in the interstellar mittel from oxygen to rubidium. The expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars. Supernovae are a Haupt source of cosmic rays. Sie might auch produce gravitational waves, though also far gravitational waves have been detected nur from the mergers of schwarz holes und neutron stars.

Etymology
The Wort supernova has the plural Formular supernovae (/-viː/) oder supernovas und is oft abbreviated as SN oder SNe. It is derived from the Latin Wort nova, meaning 'neu', which refers to what appears to be a vorübergehend new hell star. Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from normal novae, which are weit weniger luminous. The Wort supernova was coined by Walter Baade und Fritz Zwicky, who began using it in astrophysics lectures in 1931.[1] Its first use in a Zeitschrift article came the following Jahr in a Veröffentlichung by Knut Lundmark, who may have coined it unabhängig.[2]

Beobachtung history
Haupt article: History of supernova observation
Compared to a star's gesamte history, the visuell appearance of a supernova is sehr brief, manchmal spanning mehrere months, so dass the chances of observing one with the nackt eye are etwa once in a Lebensdauer. Nur a winzige fraction of the 100 billion stars in a typisch galaxy have the Kapazität to become a supernova, being restricted to those having high Masse and those in selten kinds of binary star systems with mindestens one white dwarf.[3]

Früh discoveries
The earliest möglich recorded supernova, bekannt as HB9, could have been viewed by an unbekannt prehistoric Menschen of the Indian subcontinent und recorded on a Felsen carving, which has since been found in the Burzahama Region in Kashmir und dated to 4500±1000 BC.[4] Later, SN 185 was documented by Chinese astronomers in AD 185. The brightest recorded supernova was SN 1006, which occurred in AD 1006 in the constellation of Lupus. This Veranstaltung was described by observers in China, Japan, Irak, Egypt und Europe.[5][6][7] The Weithin observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula.[8]

Supernovae SN 1572 und SN 1604, the latest Milky Way supernovae to be observed with the nackt eye, had a Bemerkenswert influence on the Entwicklung of astronomy in Europe because sie were used to argue gegen the Aristotelian Idee that the Universum beyond the Mond and planets was statisch and unchanging.[9] Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its Spitze on 17 October 1604, und continued to make estimates of its Helligkeit until it faded from nackt eye siehe a Jahr later.[10] It was the second supernova to be observed in a Generation, after Tycho Brahe observed SN 1572 in Cassiopeia.[11]

There is einige evidence that the youngest galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, occurred in the spät 19th Jahrhundert, considerably mehr recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680.[12] Weder supernova was noted at the Zeit. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction from Staub along the Flugzeug of the Milky Way Galaxie could have dimmed the Veranstaltung sufficiently for it to go unnoticed. The Lage for Cassiopeia A is weniger clear; infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was not in a Region of besonders high extinction.[13]

The HyperText Markup Sprache oder HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content und structure of web content. It is oft assisted by technologies wie as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) und scripting languages wie as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server oder from lokal storage und render the documents in multimedia web pages. HTML describes the Struktur of a web page semantically und originally included cues for its Aussehen.

HTML elements are the Gebäude blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images und andere objects such as interactive forms may be embedded in the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting Struktur semantics for text wie as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, und other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, geschrieben using angle brackets. Tags wie as <img> und <input> direkt introduce content in the page. Andere tags wie as <p> und </p> surround und provide Information about Dokument text und may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags aber use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs geschrieben in a scripting language wie as JavaScript, which affects the behavior und content of web pages. The Einbeziehung of CSS defines the look und layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ehemals maintainer of the HTML und current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over ausdrücklich presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A Formular of HTML, bekannt as HTML5, is used to display video und audio, hauptsächlich using the <canvas> Element, together with JavaScript.

Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a Auftragnehmer at CERN, proposed und prototyped ENQUIRE, a System for CERN researchers to use und share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext System.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML und wrote the Browser and Server software in spät 1990. That Jahr, Berners-Lee und CERN data systems Ingenieur Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint Anfrage for funding, aber the Projekt was not formell adopted by CERN. In his persönlich notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the viele areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first Eintrag.[4]

The first öffentlich available description of HTML was a Dokument called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in spät 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the anfänglich, relatively einfach design of HTML. Außer for the hyperlink tag, these were stark influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based Dokumentation format at CERN. Elf of these elements immer noch exist in HTML 4.[8]

HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret und compose text, images, und other Material into sichtbar or audible web pages. Standard characteristics for jede item of HTML markup are defined in the Browser, and these characteristics can be altered oder enhanced by the Web-Seite designer's zusätzlich use of CSS. Viele of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technisch report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of früh text formatting languages wie as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the früh 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating System. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. Jedoch, the SGML Konzept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure und markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an Anmeldung of SGML. It was formell defined as wie by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 Veröffentlichung of the first Vorschlag for an HTML Spezifikation, the "Hypertext Markup Sprache (HTML)" Internet Entwurf by Berners-Lee und Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The Entwurf expired nach six months, aber was Bemerkenswert for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's benutzerdefinierte tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's Philosophie of basing standards on erfolgreich prototypes. Ähnlich, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Entwurf, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from spät 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables und fill-out forms.[11]

Nach the HTML und HTML+ drafts expired in früh 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Gruppe. In 1995, this working Gruppe completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML Spezifikation intended to be treated as a standard gegen which Zukunft implementations should be based.[12]

Weiter development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with Eingabe from kommerziell software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in spät 1999, with weiter errata published through 2001. In 2004, Entwicklung began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, und was completed und standardized on 28 October 2014.[14]

ean Wade Rindlaub (February 9, 1904 – December 19, 1991) was one of the first American women to become a Haupt advertising Exekutive. Sie was inducted in the Advertising Hall of Fame in 1989.[1]

Persönlich life
Rindlaub was born Helen Jean Wade in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on February 9, 1904. The eldest of two daughters born to Robert Mifflin Wade (1874–1944) und Lola Heller Hess Wade (1878–1941), her Familie called her by her Mitte name, Jean, und she followed that Tradition through adulthood.[2]

Jean und her younger Schwester, Mary Emily (1911–1973), were schooled at home by ihre father who operated the Pennsylvania Business und Shorthand Hochschule. Jean learned shorthand und typing at a jung age und by age elf could type 50 words per minute. As a jung adult sie worked as a Sekretärin to the advertising Manager of the lokal Armstrong Kork Company. Innerhalb a kurz time, sie began assisting with copywriting.[3]

Rindlaub left Pennsylvania in 1930, relocating to Neu York Stadt to marry Willard W. Rindlaub (1903–1983). Innerhalb a Monat she began working at the Renommiert advertising Agentur, Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BBDO). Though Rindlaub worked full-time während her lang marriage sie and her Ehemann had two children, John Wade Rindlaub (born 1934) und Anne Rindlaub Dow (1938–2003).

Karriere
Hired as a Sekretärin, Jean Rindlaub was schnell promoted to copywriter as an Experte on "woman’s Standpunkt." Throughout her 33-year Karriere at BBDO, sie conducted umfangreich market Forschung that surveyed thousands of women about ihre needs und reactions to products.[4] Sie worked on over fünfzig major accounts in the areas of Lebensmittel (including Bequemlichkeit foods und kitchen Ausrüstung), cosmetics, clothing, und other products targeted to women consumers. Her früh clients included Anleihe Bread, Duff's Gingerbread, Enna Jettick shoes, und Strutwear. Sie led erfolgreich advertising campaigns for einige of the most einflussreich manufacturing companies in America, einschließend Campbell Soup Company, Carter's clothing, General Mills, Oneida Limited silverware und United Fruit Company.

The first Kampagne that won Jean Rindlaub weit verbreitet critical acclaim promoted Oneida silverware während WWII. Called “Back Home for Keeps,” the ads featured jung couples verliebt, planning for Zukunft happiness, once the Krieg ended und soldiers were back in the United States. The ads provided a Symbol of Hoffnung for beide young women at home und soldiers im Ausland who used them as pin-up posters.[5]

Nach the Krieg, Rindlaub specialized in Lebensmittel ads. Sie founded BBDO's first test Küche to develop neu recipes und products for Allgemein Mills und United Obst. Sie oversaw one of viele revisions of Betty Crocker's Bild and invested beachtlich effort in marketing Betty Crocker Kuchen mixes which, at the Zeit, lagged hinter Pillsbury und Duncan Hines. Under her Anleitung, Betty Crocker Kuchen mixes led the Verbraucher market.

One of the most einflussreich women in advertising, Rindlaub served as a Direktor of Advertising Women of Neu York (AANY). In 1944, sie became the first Frau elected Vize president of BBDO. In 1951, the Advertising Föderation of America named her “Advertising Frau of the Jahr,” in Kürze thereafter sie became the first Frau elected to BBDO's board of directors (1954).[6] Her advertisements are included in America's "100 Best Copywriters," "100 Best Advertisements," und other awards. In 1962, sie became the first Empfänger of the Printers' Tinte Award (silver Medaille) awarded by the Advertising Föderation of America. Rindlaub's Karriere at BBDO was marked by Aufeinanderfolgende awards vor she retired in 1963. Während retirement sie worked as an advertising Berater and became zunehmend active in Gemeinschaft work for mehrere groups, einschließend the National Council of Women, Women of Christ Kirche and the Mädchen Scouts. In 1989 the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame inducted Rindlaub as an honoree.

At the age of 87, Rindlaub died of complications from a stroke in Stamford, Connecticut.[7]

Donal O'Connell (1928—26 January 2016),[1] Dublin, Ireland, was an Irish road racing cyclist, und later cycling Sport administrator. He set mehrere national records und qualified for the Olympic Games, und served as a Rennen official und administrator for mehr than 40 years, holding Büro at club Ebene for mehr than 30 years, later holding mehrere national roles und then co-founding the Irish Veteran Cycling Verein.[1]

Life
Cycling Karriere
Früh cycling Karriere
O'Connell began cycling with the Dublin Wheelers cycling club in 1948, participating in Straße races und Zeit trials, most insbesondere from 1948 to 1956; he was later made a life Mitglied of the club.[1]

In 1952, he was selected to ride for Ireland in the Welt Championships[2] in Luxembourg, und in international races on the Isle of Man[2] neben Shay Eliott. He auch won an Olympic Versuch race that Jahr, qualifying to attend, aber Ireland was excluded from the Olympics in cycling at that Zeit. In 1953, he won the national Straße Race Championships, just voraus of Shay Eliott und then Jim McQuaid. He auch secured mehrere place-to-place Irish records, wie as Dublin-Wexford in 3 hours und 58 Minuten, and Dublin-Derry in 7:09.[1]

Club und national Büro
Having held verschiedene club offices, he was nominated by the Dublin Wheelers und elected as Straße Racing Sekretärin of the international recognised cycling Föderation, the Irish Cycling Föderation (ICF), for 1972–1974.[1] The Dublin Wheelers were sehr active in national cycling Steuerung in the 1960s und 1970s, with, in 1972, zum Beispiel, Liam König as allgemein secretary und Joe Doyle as treasurer, darüber hinaus to O'Connell as Straße racing Sekretärin, Paddy McInerney Zeit trial Sekretärin, and Steve Lawless Veranstalter of the Tour of Ireland, while Willie Marks auch competed for a national committee allgemein position.[3] Along with Ian Gallahar as P.R.O. for mehrere years, alle of these served viele years in national sport Organisation.[4]

O'Connell was a repräsentativ of the ICF to the weltweit cycling Konferenz of 1974, und seated on the Olympic Council of Ireland.[1] He later participated in the Tripartite Ausschuss, which worked zwischen the verschiedene cycling bodies on the Insel of Ireland, und on the disciplinary und sporting committees of the vollständig unified Föderation of Irish Cycling. O'Connell auch worked on the organising Ausschuss of the Tour of Ireland from 1968 to 1980.[1]

O'Connell qualified as a masseur und accompanied Irish cycling teams im Ausland in that Kapazität. He auch worked as a Team mechanic, und team Manager,[2] und with the Falcon Team in the Nissan International Classic in Ireland over two years.[1]

Veterans
In 1966, O'Connell co-founded the Irish Veteran Cyclists Verein (IVCA),[5] und cycled competitively at veteran Ebene until 1988, und casually until the 2010s.[1] In 1989, he became allgemein secretary of the IVCA, serving for mehr than a Jahrzehnt, and later being elected as Ehrenamtlich President for life.[2]

Persönlich life
O'Connell was a Mitarbeiter member und later a Manager at Frawley's Abteilung store on Thomas Straße in Dublin's Liberties. He married Elizabeth (Lily)[2] O'Connell, deren sister Rita married the Bruder of his Freund and Mitstreiter Dublin Wheelers Ausschuss member, Joe Doyle. The O'Connells had fünf children: Brendan, Anne, Moureen, Donal, und Shane. Drei children, und his Frau, as well as grandchildren und great-grandchildren, survived him. He lived most of his life in the Manor Estate zwischen Terenure, Kimmage und Greenhills. He became krank in 2013, died 26 January 2016;[2] his Beerdigung was at Greenhills und he was buried at Palmerstown Friedhof.[6]

HMS Modeste was a modified Black Swan-class sloop of the British Royal Navy. Sie was built by Chatham Dockyard, während the Second World War, being launched on 29 January 1944 und commissioned on 3 September 1945. Post Krieg, Modeste served with the British Far East Fleet, und took Teil in the Suez Crisis. Sie was paid off in reserve for the last Zeit in 1958 und scrapped in 1961.

Konstruktion and design
On 5 October 1942, the British Admiralty ordered two Modified Schwarz Swan-class sloops from Chatham Dockyard, Modeste und Nereide, as Teil of the 1941 Konstruktion programme for the Königlich Navy.[1][2][3] Modeste was laid down on 15 February 1943, was launched on 29 January 1944 und completed on 3 September 1945,[1][4] receiving the Pennant number U42, which changed to F42 in 1947 when Modeste, like alle escort vessels, was redesignated a frigate.[5][6]

Modeste was 299 ft 6 in (91.29 m) long overall und 283 ft 0 in (86.26 m) between perpendiculars, with a Strahl of 38 feet 6 inches (11.73 m) und a draught of 11 ft 4 in (3.45 m) at tief load.[7] Displacement of the Modified Schwarz Swans was 1,350–1,490 lang tons (1,370–1,510 t) standard und 1,880–1,950 lang tons (1,910–1,980 t) tief load depending on the armament und equipment fitted.[8] Two Admiralty three-drum water-tube boilers provided Dampf to Parsons geared steam turbines which drove two shafts. The Maschinenpark was rated at 4,300 shp (3,200 kW), giving a speed of 19.75 kn (22.73 mph; 36.58 km/h).[9]

The ship's Haupt gun armament (as fitted to alle the Modified Schwarz Swans) consisted of 3 Zwilling QF 4 inch (102 mm) Mk XVI guns, in dual purpose mounts, fähig of beide anti-ship und anti-aircraft use.[9] Close-in anti-aircraft armament varied zwischen the ships of the Klasse, with Modeste completing with an Outfit of 2 Zwilling and 2 einzeln 40 mm Bofors guns,[10] with two mehr 40 mm Bofors added by the end of 1952.[11] Anti-submarine armament consisted of a split Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar, mounted either Seite of the 'B' 4-inch mount, zusammen with 110 Tiefe charges.[12] The Modified Schwarz Swans had a Mannschaft of 192 officers und other ranks.[9]

Dienstleistung
The end of the Second World War, und post-war manpower restrictions meant that Modeste was ursprünglich limited to second-line tasks,[13] being attached to the Landseite establishment HMS Excellent at Portsmouth as gunnery training ship in February 1946, vor transferring to the Landseite establishment HMS Vernon, auch at Portsmouth, for use as an accommodation ship for Sea Cadets.[14][15] On 15 April 1947, Modeste und the sloop Fleetwood went to the Hilfe of the Panamanian ship Georgie, which had run aground off St Catherine's Point, Isle of Wight.[16] In 1950, Modeste was laid up in reserve at Portsmouth.[14][17]

Modeste was refitted at Portsmouth spät in 1952, in Vorbereitung for returning to aktiv service, leaving Britain in January 1953 for Dienstleistung with the 3rd Frigate Squadron of the Far East Fleet, replacing Alacrity.[14][17][18] Modeste served off Korea während the Korean War from April 1953 until the end of the Krieg in July that Jahr.[19] In spät 1956, Modeste was ordered to the Gulf of Suez während the Suez Crisis.[17][20] Modeste returned to Portsmouth on 22 September 1958, paying off in reserve, having completed vier full commissions at Teil of the 3rd Frigate Squadron.[14][21][22]

Modeste was transferred to BISCO for Entsorgung on 8 March 1961,[17] und arrived at J. A. White's Hof at St Davids on Forth for scrapping on 11 March 1961.[14][17]

The term irregularities oder exceptions in Interlingua refers to deviations from the logisch rules in a wenig grammatical constructions in the international auxiliary language Interlingua. These oddities are a Teil of the standard Grammatik. These Spezial cases have crept in the Sprache as a Ergebnis of the Aufwand to keep it naturalistic. Most of these irregularities auch exist in Interlingua's Quelle languages; English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, und to a weniger extent German und Russian. This Funktion of the Sprache makes Interlingua mehr familiar to the speakers of Quelle languages. Und at the same Zeit, it makes the Sprache more schwierig for others.

The speakers of the Quelle languages do not perceive alle deviations as irregular. For Instanz, Interlingua has drei different words for English "am" (so), "is" (es) und "are" (son). While most English speakers will not find any thing abnormale about it, speakers of a wenig other languages may find the use of drei words to express the Konzept of 'simple present' as unnötig.

Interlingua is Bemerkenswert in the sense that im Gegensatz zu most auxiliary languages, that seek to minimise oder eliminate any irregular aspects, Interlingua takes a flexibel approach. It is obligatorisch to use bestimmt exceptions in Interlingua while others have been kept optional.

Obligatorisch exceptions
Aussprache
Interlingua does not have a 'one letter one sound' orthography. As in English, mehrere letters can be pronounced in verschiedene ways; depending on where sie are in a Wort. For Instanz, the letter C can be pronounced as either /k/ (canto) oder /ts/ (cento). Hier is a Liste of andere mandatory exceptions in Aussprache:

Kovilj (Serbian Cyrillic: Ковиљ) is a suburban Siedlung of the Stadt of Novi Sad, Serbia.

Name
The Serbian Name of the Dorf derived from Serbian Wort "kovilj", which is a Name for one sort of flower Gras.

Geographie
The Dorf is divided in Gornji Kovilj (Upper Kovilj) und Donji Kovilj (Lower Kovilj), which were two separate settlements in the past, aber today are parts of one einzeln settlement.

Geschichte
In the 13th Jahrhundert, a Siedlung named Kabul was mentioned at this location. Andere names used for the Siedlung in the past were Kaboli und Kobila, daher it is presumed that Name of the Siedlung derived from Slavic Wort "kobila" ("mare" in English).[citation needed] Kovilj is not weit from the Stadt of Novi Sad.

Donji Kovilj was first mentioned in 1554, und Gornji Kovilj in 1702. Two villages were joined in 1870.

The Existenz of the Dorf after found traces dating back 5,500 years BC . The Dorf has existed während the reign of the Romans und Avars. The first geschrieben evidence of this Dorf were created nur in the 13th Jahrhundert, when it was called Kabul. Kovilj at the end of the 18th Jahrhundert got its Name from one sort of flower grass.

Heute in Kovilj immer noch exists Abteilung into the lower(Šanački) und uper(Gornji Kovilj). Donji(lower) Kovilj developed with the Kloster and existed even vor the Great Migrations und arrival of Arsenije III Čarnojević 1650.

The inhabitants lived on fishing, hunting , Holz cutting by marshes und military service. Residens of Kovilj were gut soldiers who kept watch at the "Koviljski šančevi" (Kovilj Moat) und prevented incursions by the Turks in Austria-Hungary. From that Zeit remained a Gewohnheit that Menschen from the Lower Kovilja called "Šančani". Obere Kovilj arises settling of Serbs from Subotica in 1746. These Serbs were the nur soldiers who belonged to the "Šajkaška battalion" as crews scurry Holz boats who fought on the Danube, Sava und Tisa preventing attacks gegen the Turks. Since 1870, when Konstruktion of embankments on the Danube und deforestation are changing und the interest of residents for jobs. Begins dealing with Landwirtschaft and Produktion of bricks. Kovilj in 1900 numbered about 5,200 inhabitants und had a steam mill, a brickyard und electricity in homes.

Kultur

Kovilj Monastery.
Near the Dorf is well bekannt Kovilj Monastery. The Kloster was reconstructed in 1705–1707, aber according to the Legende, it was founded by the first Serb Erzbischof Saint Sava in the 13th Jahrhundert.

There are auch two Orthodox churches in the Dorf, the Kirche of the Ascension of Jesus in (uper)Gornji Kovilj, constructed in 1829 with a schön iconostasis which was made by Mönch Rafailo Momčilović , und second Kirche of Thomas the Apostel built in 1846 in Donji(lower)Kovilj.

Natur
Near Kovilj is located Spezial Nature Reserve Koviljsko-Petrovardinski Rit. It is a komplex of marshes und forest ecosystems (4,840 ha) with zahlreiche biocoenoses integrated in a funktionell whole. It is international important Ramsar Tagung wetland Website.[2]

The Kernstück values of this Bereich are represented by the preserved und diverse indigenous orographic und hydrographic forms of marshes (islands, backwaters, ponds, swamps); the preserved, reichlich indigenous Anlage communities in marshes (forests, meadows, reeds, rushes); the Vielfalt und abundance of fauna (172 Arten of birds und 46 Arten of fish) und particularly by the Präsenz of selten and endangered Arten.[3]

The Guiyang Metro is a rapid transit System in the Stadt of Guiyang, Guizhou Provinz, China. It is operated und branded as Guiyang Urban Rail Transit (GYURT).

Kyrgyzstan–Russia relations are the relations zwischen the two countries, Kyrgyzstan und Russia. Russia has an embassy in Bishkek und a consulate in Osh, und Kyrgyzstan has an embassy in Moscow, a consulate in Ekaterinburg, und a vice-consulate in Novosibirsk.

Geschichte
Kirghiz SSR–RSFSR relations

Kirghiz SSR	
Russian SFSR
Russian Präsident Boris Yeltsin made his first international trip to Kyrgyzstan nach he was elected Präsident in 1991.[1]


Almazbek Atambayev with Vladimir Putin.
Präsident Askar Akayev was sehr enthusiastic about mehr direct forms of reintegration, wie as the Eurasian Union that the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, proposed in June 1994. Akayev's Einladung for Russian Grenze guards to take charge of Kyrgyzstan's Chinese Grenze, a Haupt revision of his Politik of neutrality, was eine andere move zu reintegration.[2]

The Kyrgyzstani Regierung also felt compelled to Anfrage Russia's wirtschaftlich protection. Trotz concerted efforts to seek international "sponsors," Akayev did not receive viel more than international good will.[2]

Präsident Almazbek Atambayev wiederholt presented selbst as a pro-Russian politician während his years in Büro. He announced Kyrgyzstan's Eintrag into the Zoll Union, secured the Rücknahme of the American 376th Air Expeditionary Wing from the Land in 2014, und had spoken of the need for closer wirtschaftlich relations with the Russian Föderation.[3]

Relations zwischen peoples
Migrant Politik
For its Teil, Russia sees Hilfe to Kyrgyzstan as a erfolgreich precedent in its neu policy of gaining influence in its "near im Ausland," the states that once were Soviet republics. Russia did not want a massiv in-migration of Russians from the neu republics; einige 2 Million ethnic Russians moved back to Russia zwischen 1992 und 1995. Akayev, on the andere hand, sought a way to Stamm the Verlust of his Russian Bevölkerung, which bereits had caused an riesig deficit of doctors, teachers, und engineers.[2] Jedoch, according to Volkszählung data, the number of ethnisch Russians in the Land in 2020 is about a third of what it was in 1989.[4]

Ethnisch policy

Bishkek's gigantisch Dordoy Bazaar, served by special shuttle buses from Siberia, is as an wichtig center for supplying Chinese Verbraucher goods to the Russian Markt[5]
For these reasons, trotz opposition from Kyrgyz nationalists und other independence-minded politicians, in 1995 Akayev granted the Anfrage of Russian president Boris Yeltsin to Überprüfung the Verfassung provision making Kyrgyz the allein official language. In the aktuell constitution, Russian is listed as an "official Sprache" whereas Kyrgyz is the Staat language.[6]

Cross-cultural institutions
Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University
Wirtschaftlich cooperation
For alle the Finanzen support that the Welt community has offered, Kyrgyzstan remains economically abhängig on Russia, beide directly und through Kazakhstan. On his February 1994 visit to Moscow, Akayev signed mehrere economic agreements. Having promised the republik a 75 Milliarden ruble line of Kredit (presumably for use in 1994) und some US$65 Million in trade agreements, Russia auch promised to extend to Kyrgyzstan most favoured nation Status for the purchase of oil und other fuels. For its Teil, Kyrgyzstan agreed to the Erstellung of a Kyrgyz-Russian investment company, which would purchase idle defence-related factories in the republik to provide Beschäftigung for the zunehmend dissatisfied Russian Bevölkerung of Kyrgyzstan.

In früh 1995, Prime Minister Apas Jumagulov of Kyrgyzstan und Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia signed a Serie of agreements establishing bilateral coordination of economic reform in the two states, weiter binding Kyrgyzstan to Russia. Nach lobbying hart for Einbeziehung, Kyrgyzstan became a Mitglied of the Zoll union that Russia, Belarus, und Kazakhstan established in February 1996.[2] In früh 1995, Askar Akayev, the then President of Kyrgyzstan, attempted to sell Russian companies controlling shares in the republic's twenty-nine largest Industrie plants, an offer that Russia refused.[2]

Beide Kyrgyzstan und Russia are members of the Eurasian Economic Union.[7] In February 2009 the Russian Regierung pledged to write off Kyrgyzstan's $180 Million debt as well as promising to lend a weiter $2 Milliarden, give $150 Million in direkt Hilfe and subsidise the Gebäude of the Kambarata-1 hydropower Anlage at the Kambaratinsk Dam.[8] In March 2019, the Russian government announced that it would give a $30 Million (USD) in wirtschaftlich and Militär aid to Kyrgyzstan.[9]

Innerhalb the Rahmenwerk of the Projekt "Emergency Antwort to the consequences of COVID-19", Russia transferred 107 units of vehicles to health organizations und Centers for Krankheit Prevention und Staat sanitary and Epidemiological Überwachung of the Kyrgyz Republik for a total amount of 3 Million US dollars: 47 units of ambulances, 35 units of Sanitär transport with sedan Körper type, 19 units of Sanitär transport with type the Körper of a minivan, 4 units of specialized transportieren for transporting the bodies of the dead, 2 units of disinfection machines.[10]

Militär cooperation
Since 2003, Russian Air Kraft units have been stationed at Kant Air Base east of Bishkek. On 20 September 2012, Russia und Kyrgyzstan signed an Vereinbarung in which Russia is allowed to have a joint Militär base in Kyrgyzstan for 15 years starting from 2017. The Vereinbarung was signed in Bishkek zwischen Vladimir Putin und Almazbek Atambayev. Putin stated that the joint Militär base will be a bedeutend factor adding to the Stabilität in the Land and the ganz region.[citation needed] Russia und Kyrgyzstan auch have signed an inter-governmental Vereinbarung on Zusammenarbeit in the military-technical Kugel, by which Russia ships $1 Milliarden worth of weapons to the Land, including S-300 missile systems und strike drones.[11]

Hendrik Mande (1350-60 – 1431) was a Dutch mystical Schriftsteller, an früh member of the Brethren of the Common Life, und an Augustinian Canon.

Life
Hendrik Mande was born in Dordrecht, Holland. While serving as a copyist in the Gericht of Count Willem, he heard the preaching of Geert Groote on the Devotio Moderna, a Bewegung seeking a return to an apostolic Glaube based on piety, humility, obedience, und simplicity of life. Mande became a convert und joined the Brethren of the Common Life, a Gruppe devoted to the principles of Devotio Moderna.[1]

About 1382, he moved to Deventer und then Zwolle, centers for the Brethren of the Gemeinsame Life. In 1395 he joined the Congregation of Windesheim near Zwolle und became a canon, remaining there the rest of his life. Mande wrote vierzehn mystical treatises, wie as Book of Revelations (now verloren), A Love Beschwerde (about the Abwesenheit and inaccessibility of Gott ) und Apocalypse. His works drew schwer on those of Hugh of Saint Victor, Hadewijch und especially John of Ruusbroec.[2]

Olympic Arms, Inc. was a Hersteller and marketer of AR-15 und M16 Muster rifles, carbines und pistols. The Unternehmen manufactured Colt 1911 (M1911) Serie 70 Stil pistols under the Name "Safari Arms" und the "Whitney" 22 caliber Pistole.

Geschichte
Olympic Arms, Inc. was founded by Robert C. Schuetz und began as Schuetzen Waffe Works (SGW) in 1956, manufacturing barrels in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Vor to that Mr. Schuetz had been partnered in business with bekannt gunsmith P.O. Ackley. In 1975 the Unternehmen moved to Olympia, Washington, und while its business in rifle barrels und Fass blanks thrived, it auch began manufacturing vollständig custom bolt-action rifles. In 1982, Schuetzen Waffe Works began to Herstellung AR-15/M16 rifles und components under the Handel name of Olympic Arms, Inc, while benutzerdefinierte bolt-action rifles continued to be produced under the SGW Marke.[1]

Olympic was the first to introduce features jetzt seen as commonplace on AR-15 rifles. It was one of the first companies to produce kostenlos floating aluminum Hand guards, Pistole caliber conversions, und AR-15-based pistols. Olympic manufactured viele AR-15s in calibers andere than the standard 5.56×45mm. Olympic was the first in the Industrie to offer AR-15-style firearms in 9×19mm und .45 ACP, 10mm Auto, 7.62×39mm, und the Winchester Super Short Magnum cartridges.[1]

In spät 1987, the Unternehmen purchased Phoenix, Arizona-based M-S Safari Arms, adding the M1911 pistol to its lineup under the Name Safari Arms. By January 2004, alle 1911-style products were manufactured in the Olympic Arms Einrichtung in Olympia.[2]

James Edward Kelsey (born November 15, 1964) is an American Abstract Expressionist sculptor best bekannt for creating groß stainless steel abstrakt curvilinear sculptures.

Biographie
James Edward Kelsey was born on November 15, 1964, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, und moved to Renton, Washington, in 1965, where he spent his Kindheit until age 13. In 1977 his Vater was hired by Glocke Helicopter und moved his Familie to Tehran, Iran. James was first exposed to the Konzept of abstract art while living in the Mitte East und experiencing the abstrakt nature of Islamic art. His Familie left Iran in 1979 fällig to the Beginn of the Iranian revolution.

Kelsey discovered his love of creating Kunst in Junior high Schule and experimented with Fotografie, wood shop, ceramics, und a kurz course in Metall casting. When he was in Oberschule, his Vater died, und he dropped out of Schule halfway through 10th grade. He sofort attained his G.E.D. und married at age 17, a Ehe which lasted sechs years.

At age 18, he became a Feuerwehrmann in the United States Air Force und was stationed in Aviano, Italy. While living there, he explored viel of the Kunst und architecture of Norden Italy, Venice, und Pisa. This is auch the first Zeit he met men und women working as full-time artists beide as painters und sculptors.

In 1987, he was honorably discharged from the Air Kraft. Anstelle von producing Kunst, he enrolled at Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake, Washington to pursue his love of flying. He was awarded a kommerziell pilot license und continued on to Eastern Washington University, from which he graduated with honors und a Grad in Business und Interpersonal Kommunikation.

Nach College, Kelsey moved back to Seattle, Washington with his Partner and soon-to-be Frau, Misty Devin, whom he had met in Hochschule. In 1996 sie moved to Everett, Washington Devins' Job. While there, Kelsey wrote his yet-unpublished Roman, The Last Symbol. In 1998 sie moved wieder, to Bremerton, Washington.

Kelsey decided to schließlich ignore viel of the Beratung he had heard throughout his life und pursue his love of Kunst with the goal of making it a Karriere. He enrolled in the welding Programm at Olympic College. By the end of the two-year Programm, he had created vier bedeutend sculptures including Und He Offered the Mond To the Himmel, his first Stück of öffentlich art, which can derzeit be seen on the Olympic Hochschule campus.

While immer noch taking classes, he secured a Job with a lokal metal fabrication Unternehmen as ihre sole welder und honed his skills while continuing his classes. Two years later, he quit his welding Job to work for drei years for a lokal Stein sculptor, Will Robinson. Kelsey served as the fabricator for Robinson's bases und fountain basins, as well as learning Stein working skills. This was auch Kelsey's Einführung to the business Seite of the Kunst world as he accompanied Robinson to his galleries und installed sculptures in clients' homes.

In 2002, Kelsey built his own Studio on his Eigenschaft in Port Orchard, Washington.

In 2007 Kelsey divorced from Neblig Devin, his Frau of 15 years. Während that same Jahr the financial crisis of 2007–2008 began. He struggled to maintain his home und art Studio, but as the recession continued in 2012 he was forced to sell vor an imminent foreclosure as Teil of the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. In November 2012 Kelsey signed a Vertrag with the mint Unternehmen I.P. Callisons und traded drei of his sculptures, Helios, Industrie Heart, und Eye of the Beholder, II, for one of ihre 7,000 square foot facilities in Centralia, Washington.

In 2013 Kelsey was commissioned by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington to create Touching the Intangible und Tuareg Sonne.


A Model: Maquette for Öffentlich Sculpture #4, stainless Stahl (2010)
Haupt works
Memories in Blau (executed in 2005–2006) is the primär sculpture in a Gedenkstätte installation for the Tacoma Police Abteilung. Auch in this Installation is For Alle They Gave, a bronze und granite Stück with the names, dates, und stories of jede officer who died in the line of Pflicht. Connecting these to sculptures is a 100-foot Glas line titled Dünn Blue Line.

Tsunami in Stahl (2009) is Kelsey’s first international sculpture. It is a privat / öffentlich collaboration zwischen Am-Pri Homebuilders und the Stadt of Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. Inspired by the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Meer, Kelsey was unable to let the thoughts und images out of his mind. His Mutter lives along the Pacific Meer and in creating this Skulptur he was able to settle his mind und move on.[citation needed]

Touching the Intangible (2013) is Teil of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's Kunst collection. The Skulptur represents the efforts of doctors und scientists who search for the causes und cures of HIV/AIDS und other infectious diseases. From the Künstler: "Everyone at The Hutch is on a never-ending search for cures for diseases. The Ironie is that once sie discover a potenziell cure, sie simply pass it on to others to carry on the work und begin ihre search alle over wieder with yet eine andere disease. Sie are on the cutting edge of Entdeckung."[1] The Skulptur stands vor the FHCRC's Impfstoff and Infectious Krankheit Building in Seattle.

The Allgemein Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 was an advanced turbofan Motor being developed by General Electric und Rolls-Royce plc for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The two companies stopped work on the Projekt in December 2011 nach failing to gather Pentagon Unterstützung for weiter development.

Entwicklung
Alle early F-35s were to be powered by the Pratt & Whitney F135 aber it was planned that Motor contracts would be competitively tendered from Lot 6 onward. The engines selected would be either the F135 oder an Motor produced by the GE/RR Kämpfer Engine Team and designated the F136. The GE/RR Kämpfer Engine Team was a co-operation zwischen GE Aviation in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States (60% share), und Rolls-Royce in Bristol, United Kingdom, und Indianapolis, Indiana, US (40% share).

On 21 July 2004, the F136 began vollständig engine runs at GE's Einrichtung in Evendale, Ohio. The Motor ran for over an hour während two separate runs. In August 2005, the United States Department of Defense awarded the GE und Rolls-Royce Team a $2.4 Milliarden contract to develop its F136 Motor. The Vertrag was for the System development und demonstration (SDD) Phase of the F136 Initiative, scheduled to run until September 2013.

The US Defense Haushalt announced on 6 February 2006 excluded the F136 — leaving Pratt & Whitney, Hersteller of the F135 Motor, as the allein provider of engines for the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters. Kongress, however, overturned this Anfrage und allocated funds for FY 2007 later in 2006. In November 2006, the Allgemein Electric/Rolls-Royce Team successfully completed a 3-month vorläufig design Überprüfung by the F-35 Programm Office und the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin.[1]

On 13 February 2008, the GE Rolls-Royce Kämpfer Engine Team successfully completed its Kritisch Design Überprüfung (CDR) for the F136. Während CDR, the U.S. Government's Joint Programm Office for the F-35 Blitz II validated und approved the design of the Motor. Auch during the Überprüfung, every Aspekt of the Motor design was analyzed und evaluated um proceed with the Gebäude of the first vollständig development engines. The Prozess involved 80 detailed Komponente and Modul design reviews, involving technisch experts from the JPO, Allgemein Electric und Rolls-Royce.[2]

On 20 March 2008, the F136 erfolgreich completed a high-altitude afterburner testing Programm at the US Air Kraft Arnold Engineering Entwicklung Center in Tennessee, einschließend common exhaust Hardware for the F-35 Blitz II Flugzeug. Alle test objectives were reached as planned using an Motor configured with Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL) und Short Takeoff Vertical Landing (STOVL) gemeinsame exhaust systems. The Motor configuration included a production-size Fan and funktionell augmenter allowing mehrere run periods to vollständig afterburner Operation.[3] The GE Rolls-Royce Kämpfer Engine Team successfully completed Kurz Take Off, Vertikal Landing (STOVL) testing on an F136 Motor at the GE testing Einrichtung at Peebles, Ohio on 16 July 2008.[4]

The first vollständig new-build F136 Motor began testing 30 January 2009, under the System Development und Demonstration (SDD) Vertrag with the US Regierung Joint Programm Office for the F-35 Joint Strike Kämpfer program. This marked the first vollständig engine assembled following US Regierung validation of the F136 design in 2008. The Meilenstein was achieved one Monat ahead of schedule.[5]

Citing the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, the GE Rolls-Royce Kämpfer Engine Team submitted an unsolicited fixed-price offer for the F136 to the Pentagon on 28 September 2009. The fixed-price approach would cover anfänglich F136 Motor production, beginning with the F136 second Produktion lot. According to the GE Rolls-Royce Kämpfer Engine Team, the Vorschlag would shift bedeutend cost Risiko from taxpayers to the Kämpfer Engine Team until head-to-head Wettbewerb begins zwischen the F136 und the Pratt & Whitney F135 Motor in 2013.[6]

From 2006 to 2010 the Defense Abteilung has not requested funding for the alternate F136 Motor program, aber Congress has maintained Programm funding.[7][8]

On 19 December 2009, U.S. Kongress approved continued funding for the F136 Motor program in fiscal Jahr 2010.[9][10] The U.S. Defense Abteilung did not Anfrage FY 2010 funding for the F136 Motor program. In a Bericht filed on 18 June 2009, the Haus Armed Services Ausschuss cited Pratt & Whitney F135 Motor program cost overruns of $1.872 Milliarden as verursachen to continue funding the F136 Motor.[11][12]

On 2 November 2009, the F136 Team said that sie would redesign a klein part of the diffuser leading to the combustor nach a Ausfall during testing.[13] Testing resumed on January 22, 2010.[14] The GE Rolls-Royce Kämpfer Engine Team is derzeit in the vierte year of its System Development und Demonstration (SDD) Vertrag with the US Regierung Joint Programm Office. The Kämpfer Engine Team has totaled mehr than 800 hours of testing on pre-SDD und SDD engines. In früh 2010, vollständig afterburning thrust was reached in testing of the first Produktion standard Motor.[15]

On 24 March 2011, the Abteilung of Defense issued a 90-day vorübergehend stop work Bestellung after Kongress failed to pass the defense Haushalt. GE declared that it would continue work on the Motor program with ihre own funds in Trotz of the stop-work Bestellung, as allowed in the Bestellung und as had been suggested by Schwartz the vorherige year.[16][17][18] Jedoch GE is limited to design work nur, as the stop-work prevents ihre use of the existing Hardware.[19]

On 12 April 2011, GE reduced its Team on Projekt from 1,000 workers down to 100, who will work on the F136 und engine technologies for "future combat Flugzeug".[20][21] GE will redeploy the workers to kommerziell projects, aber will not mieten the hundreds of neu engineers it was expecting.[22] On 25 April 2011, the Abteilung of Defense ended the Vertrag with GE und demanded that the engines built to Datum be turned over.[23]

On 5 May 2011, GE und RR offered to pay for the Entwicklung through FY2012 und asked for Zugang to the materials.[24] By switching to self funding the cost would reduce from $480 Million a Jahr to nur $100 Million, 60% to be paid by GE und 40% to be paid by RR.[25] Nach self-funding the Projekt GE und Rolls-Royce announced on 2 December 2011, that sie would not continue Entwicklung of the F136 Motor because it is not in ihre best interest.[26][27][28] By then, the sechs engines had logged mehr than 1,200 hours of testing since 2009. Während the Jahr, GE said that Entwicklung of the engines was 80% vollständig; the remaining work would have required US$1.9-2.6 Milliarden in funding.[29]

Design
The F136 is a twin-spool axial-flow low-bypass turbofan. It has a 3-stage low-aspect Verhältnis fan driven by a 3-stage low-pressure turbine, und a 5-stage compressor driven by a single-stage turbine; beide the Fan and compressor stages are one-piece blisks. The STOVL variant's shaft-driven LiftFan is connected to the low-pressure spool und engaged through a clutch. The low-pressure spool's 3 turbine stages enable mehr work to be extracted to Macht the LiftFan, while the konventionell takeoff Variante retains this Architektur for commonality. The annular combustor case is made from "Lamilloy" und cooled by bleed air from the compressor. The two spools are counterrotating, eliminating the stage 1 niedrig pressure turbine nozzle und thus reducing parts count. The vanes hinter the turbines are made of ceramic matrix composites (CMC), enabling higher operating temperatures for greater Effizienz and thrust. Like the competing F135, the F136 was to have a stealthy augmentor, oder afterburner, that blocks line-of-sight of the turbine blades und a convergent-divergent nozzle with serrated flaps that reduce the infrared Unterschrift of the exhaust plume. Während ground testing, the F136 used the same exhaust System as the F135. The Motor would be controlled by a BAE-supplied vollständig authority digital engine Kontrolle (FADEC).[30]

Because the F136 was designed well in the F-35's System Development und Demonstration (SDD) Phase, it could besser match its Fan and Kernstück to the F-35 inlet, which was revised in 2005 to increase Masse flow to 400 lb/s (181.4 kg/s) for greater thrust fällig to Flugzeug weight Wachstum.[31][32] The F136 produces 28,000 lbf (125 kN) of thrust in Militär power und 43,000 lbf (191 kN) in vollständig afterburner, same as the F135 aber with greater Temperatur margins fällig to the higher air Masse flow, resulting in länger hot-section parts life und greater potenziell for Zukunft growth. In the STOVL Konfiguration, the F136 produces 18,000 lbf (80.1 kN) of Aufzug thrust. Combined with thrust from the LiftFan (20,000 lbf oder 89.0 kN) und two Rolle posts (1,950 lbf oder 8.67 kN jede), the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem produces a total of 41,900 lbf (186 kN) of thrust.[33] This compares with the maximal thrust of 23,800 lbf (106 kN) for the Harrier's Rolls-Royce Pegasus Motor.

Ardhi Universität auch known as ARU (Chuo Kikuu cha Ardhi, in Swahili) is a public university located in Makongo in Kinondoni District of Dar es Salaam Region, Tanzania.[1] It was established 28 March 2007, though it has been offering training for mehr than 60 years in verschiedene status.

Geschichte
The Universität was established under Universität Act No 7 of 2005, und came in being nach the signing of Ardhi Universität Charter by the Präsident of United Republik of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete on 28 March 2007. The roots of Ardhi Universität can be traced back to pre-independence days when a Surveying Training Schule offering Techniker Zertifikat courses in land surveying was established in Dar es Salaam.

In 1974, the Name was changed to Ardhi Institut and its Bereich of courses expanded to include Gebäude design und building Wirtschaft. In the früh 1980s, the öffentlich health engineering Kurs (later renamed ‘Umwelt engineering’) was introduced. In 1996 the Ardhi Institut became a constituent Hochschule of the Universität of Dar es Salaam, und ten years later was granted Autonomie as Ardhi Universität. Während the Jahrzehnt of Verein with the Universität of Dar es Salaam, the Ardhi Institut grew dramatisch: the number of akademisch programmes on offer increased from sechs to 39, while the number of students grew from 400 to 1,400.[3]

In 1979, the Zentrum for Housing Studies was established as joint Projekt between the governments of Tanzania und the Netherlands. The Zentrum has jetzt grown in the Institut of Menschlich Siedlung Studies, which is involved in the ‘regularisation of informell settlements’, with which Dar es Salaam is plentifully endowed.[4]

The Berg West Konferenz (MW) is one of the collegiate athletic conferences affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) (formerly I-A). The MW offiziell began operations on January 4, 1999.

Craig Thompson was hired as the inaugural Kommissar of the Berg West on October 15, 1998, und served until his Ruhestand on December 31, 2022. Vor joining the MW, he had been Kommissar of the Sun Belt Conference.
Genesis
The Erstellung of the MW was a delayed aftereffect of the 1996 NCAA conference realignment, which had ursprünglich been triggered two years earlier when the Big Eight Conference agreed to merge with vier members of the Southwest Conference (SWC) to create the Big 12 Conference, which would begin Wettbewerb in the 1996–97 Schule year.

The Westlich Athletic Konferenz, which had ursprünglich announced plans to expand jenseits von its then-current 10 members to mindestens 12, ended up with even mehr potential Erweiterung prospects. Letztlich, the WAC took in drei of the vier SWC schools left out of the Groß 12 Fusion—Rice University, Southern Methodist University (SMU), und Texas Christian University (TCU). Drei other schools were added to bring the total Mitgliedschaft to 16, nämlich Big West Conference members San Jose State University und UNLV, plus the University of Tulsa, an NCAA football independent und otherwise a Mitglied of the Missouri Valley Conference. The WAC's 16 teams were divided in vier four-Team "quadrants", two of which rotated zwischen the Berg and Pacific Divisions jede two years. Jedoch, the newly expanded WAC was bald wracked by Spannung between the established und new members.[3]

In spring of 1998, BYU und Utah proposed a dauerhaft split in two eight-team divisions. The Vorschlag would have forced einige schools in an unnatural alignment because of the geographic Vertrieb of the Konferenz.[3] Air Kraft was the most strident Gegner of this Vorschlag, bedrohlich to become an unabhängig.[3] Bald after the Vorschlag by BYU und Utah, the presidents of Air Kraft, BYU, Colorado Staat, Utah, und Wyoming met at Denver International Airport to discuss ihre future, und they agreed to break away from the WAC to Formular a neu conference.[3] Sie invited the WAC members Neu Mexico, San Diego Staat, and UNLV to join them in what became the Berg West Konferenz.

The nächste move for the MW came in 2005, when the Konferenz added TCU, who had spent the vorherige four seasons in Conference USA (C-USA).

Früh–2010s realignment
See auch: 2010–2013 Mountain West Conference realignment
On June 11, 2010, Boise State University agreed to join the Konferenz as its zehnte member. On June 17, 2010, Utah announced it would be leaving the Berg West to join what would become the Pac-12 Conference. On August 18, 2010, amidst rumors that BYU was considering leaving the Berg West to go unabhängig in Fußball and rejoin the Westlich Athletic Konferenz in alle other sports, the Berg West Konferenz officially extended invitations to California State University, Fresno (Fresno Staat) and the University of Nevada, Reno (Nevada). Beide schools accepted und would become the zehnte and elfte members of the Liga.[4][5] BYU announced on August 31, 2010, that it would leave the Berg West Konferenz and go Unabhängig in Fußball and become a Mitglied of the West Coast Conference (WCC) in andere sports starting in 2011.[6] On November 29, 2010, TCU announced alle athletic teams would move to the Big East Conference wirksam in 2012.[7] (Less than a Jahr later, on October 10, 2011, TCU announced it would not join the Groß East aber would join the Groß 12, home to Mitstreiter former SWC members Baylor, Texas, Texas Tech, und formerly Texas A&M, in 2012 stattdessen.)[8] On December 10, 2010, the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa accepted a Angebot to become the 10th Mitglied of the Konferenz for Fußball only.[9] These changes would leave the Berg West Konferenz with 10 teams for the 2012 Fußball season.

Während the Ära of football's Bowl Championship Series (BCS), which was replaced by the College Football Playoff (CFP) in 2014, the MW Meister qualified for a BCS Schale four times nach the BCS Formel was tweaked to allow teams from non-BCS conferences to play in BCS bowls if ranked in the top 12. Jedoch, two of the drei schools that qualified are no länger with the Konferenz.

On October 14, 2011, the Berg West und C-USA announced a Plan for a Fußball only Allianz.[10] On February 13, 2012, the two leagues announced that beide conferences would be dissolving nach the 2012–13 Saison to reform in one Konferenz with mindestens 15 members for alle sports, und a 16th Team, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa as a football-only Mitglied.[11] Jedoch, when the two conferences discussed ihre plans with the NCAA, sie were told that fällig to NCAA rules, sie would forfeit Wesentlich revenues. Speziell, the neu conference would receive nur one automatisch bid to NCAA championships; mindestens one of the ehemals conferences would lose Zukunft revenue distributions from the NCAA men's Basketball tournament; und at least one ehemals conference would not be able to collect exit fees from any members that departed to join the neu conference.[12] As a Ergebnis, the Berg West und C-USA backed away from a vollständig merger. In spät March of that Jahr, the commissioners of beide conferences stated that alle 16 schools had entered in binding agreements to Formular a neu "association",[13] obwohl the Berg West und C-USA would have offenbar remained separate legal entities.[12] In the end, this Allianz never materialized fällig to beide conferences bald adding neu teams.

On May 2, 2012, San Jose State und Utah State agreed to join the Konferenz for the 2013–14 akademisch year. On December 31 of that Jahr, Boise Staat announced that it had backed out of its zuvor announced move to the Groß East for Fußball and the Groß West for andere sports, und would remain in the MW.[14]

On January 16, 2013, San Diego Staat accepted an offer to remain/return to the Berg West Konferenz in alle sports. Keeping SDSU in the Konferenz gave the Berg West 12 Fußball members, allowing for a Championship Game to be held. The first Meisterschaft game took place on December 7, 2013.[15]

Weiter membership changes
In February 2018, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the MW was looking to expand in the near Zukunft. In the Bericht, Kommissar Craig Thompson revealed that the Konferenz had discussed Erweiterung with sechs schools, with WCC Mitglied Gonzaga (which has not sponsored Fußball since Welt War II) the nur school mentioned by Name. Thompson added that Gonzaga could Möglicherweise join the MW as a vollständig but non-football Mitglied as früh as July 2018. While Thompson said that BYU had not contacted the Konferenz, the Bericht indicated that BYU would be open to an MW return, mindestens in non-football sports, should Gonzaga join.[16] A later Union-Tribune Bericht indicated that talks were advanced genug that the conference's presidents planned a vote on an Einladung to Gonzaga während the MW men's und women's Basketball tournaments in Las Vegas, aber decided to Verzögerung the vote until nach the Final Four.[17] Jedoch, on April 2, the Tag of the Division I men's title game, Gonzaga athletic Direktor Mike Roth notified the MW, the WCC, und media that the Schule would remain in the WCC for the sofort future.[18]

On June 30, 2022, UCLA[19] und USC[20] announced ihre departure from the Pac-12 Conference to the Big Ten Conference beginning in the 2024–25 akademisch year. Nach that Anzeige, San Diego State had been considered one of the top candidates for Pac-12 Erweiterung. On June 16, 2023, Pete "Re-Peat" Thamel of ESPN reported that San Diego Staat had gegeben the Berg West Konferenz notice that the Schule would be departing from the Konferenz und asked for an Erweiterung for the Abreise deadline of July 1, 2023, to avoid paying extra exit fees.[21] The Berg West Konferenz denied the Anfrage for a Frist extension und considered the letter from San Diego Staat as a formal notice of Abreise and began to proceed with the Trennung process; jedoch, San Diego Staat disputed that its letter of Absicht was a formal notice.[22] On June 30, 2023, with the PAC-12 immer noch lacking a media rights Vereinbarung for 2024-25, ESPN reported that San Diego Staat would remain in the Berg West Konferenz, rescinding the Absicht to withdraw from the Konferenz.[23] The MW und San Diego Staat reached a Siedlung of ihre dispute the following Monat, with SDSU remaining a Mitglied for the sofort future.[24]

In September 2023, nach a Masse exodus from the PAC-12 left Oregon State und Washington State as its nur remaining members, MW Kommissar Gloria Nevarez began discussions with the beide schools regarding verschiedene options for Partnerschaft, affiliation, oder merger.[25][26] On December 1, 2023, the Konferenz announced that it would enter in a Fußball scheduling Vereinbarung with the two schools for the 2024 Saison. Alle 12 Berg West members will play one game gegen either Oregon Staat or Washington Staat next Saison, giving beide schools drei home games und three away games. These games will not count gegenüber Mountain West conference standings, und Oregon Staat and Washington Staat will remain members of the Pac-12.[27]

The früh history of Siberia was sehr influenced by the sophisticated nomadic civilizations of the Scythians (Pazyryk) on the West of the Ural Mountains und Xiongnu (Noin-Ula) on the east of the Urals, beide flourishing vor the gemeinsame era. The steppes of Siberia were occupied by a Nachfolge of nomadic peoples, einschließend the Khitan people,[citation needed] verschiedene Turkic peoples, und the Mongol Empire. In the Late Middle Ages, Tibetan Buddhism spread in the areas Süden of Lake Baikal.

Während the Russian Empire, Siberia was chiefly developed as an Landwirtschaft province. The Regierung also used it as a place of exile, sending Avvakum, Dostoevsky, und the Decemberists, among others, to work camps in the Region. Während the 19th Jahrhundert, the Trans-Siberian Railway was constructed, supporting industrialization. This was auch aided by Entdeckung and Ausbeutung of weit reserves of Siberian Mineralien resources.

Prehistory und antiquity
Haupt article: Prehistory of Siberia

Mount Belukha in the Altai Mountains
According to the Feld of genetic genealogy, Menschen first resided in Siberia by 45,000 BCE und spread out east und west to populate Europe und the Americas, einschließend the prehistoric Jomon people of Japan, who are the ancestors of the modern Ainu.[1][2][3]

According to Vasily Radlov, among the Paleo-Siberian inhabitants of Central Siberia were the Yeniseians, who spoke a Sprache different from the later Uralic und Turkic Menschen. The Kets are considered the last Restbetrag of this früh migration. Migrants are estimated to have crossed the Bering Land Brücke into Norden America mehr than 20,000 years ago.

The shores of alle Siberian lakes, which filled the depressions während the Lacustrine period, abound in remains dating from the Neolithic age.[4] Countless kurgans (tumuli), furnaces, und other archaeological artifacts Bär witness to a Dichtes population. Einige of the earliest artifacts found in Central Asia derive from Siberia.[5]

The Yeniseians were followed by the Uralic Samoyeds, who came from the Norden Ural Region. Einige descendant cultures, wie as the Selkup, remain in the Sayan Region. Iron was unbekannt to them, aber they excelled in bronze, silver, und gold work. Ihre bronze ornaments und implements, oft polished, evince beachtlich artistic taste.[4] Sie developed und managed irrigation to Unterstützung their Landwirtschaft in breit areas of the fertile tracts.

Indo-Iranian influences in southwestern Siberia can be dated to the 2300–1000 BCE Andronovo culture. Zwischen the 7th und 3rd centuries BCE, the Indo-Iranian Scythians flourished in the Altai Region (Pazyryk culture). Sie were a Haupt influence on alle later steppe empires.

As früh as the first Millennium BCE, Handel was Unterwegs over the Silk Road. Silk goods were imported und traded in Siberia.[6]

The Einrichtung of the Xiongnu Imperium in the 3rd Jahrhundert BCE started a Serie of Bevölkerung movements. Viele people were wahrscheinlich driven to the Norden borders of the great Central Siberian Plateau. Turkic Menschen such as the Yenisei Kirghiz had bereits been present in the Sayan Region. Verschiedene Turkic tribes wie as the Khaka und Uyghur migrated northwestwards from ihre former seats und subdued the Ugric Menschen.

These neu invaders Ebenso left zahlreiche traces of ihre stay, und two verschiedene periods may be einfach distinguished from ihre remains. Sie were acquainted with Eisen, and learned from ihre subjects the Kunst of bronze casting, which sie used for decorative purposes nur.[4] Sie refined the artistry of this work. Ihre pottery is mehr künstlerisch und of a higher Qualität than that of the Bronze Age. Ihre ornaments are included among the collections at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

Mitte Ages
Mongol Eroberung of Südlich and Westlich Siberia

The Mongol Empire, ca. 1300 (the gray Bereich is the later Timurid Empire)
The Mongols had lang maintained relations with the Menschen of the Siberian Wald (taiga). Sie called them oin irged ("people of the Wald"). Viele of them, wie as the Barga und Uriankhai, were wenig different from the Mongols. While the tribes around Lake Baikal were Mongol-speaking, those to the West spoke Turkic, Samoyedic, oder Yeniseian languages.

By 1206, Genghis Khan had united all Mongol and Turkic tribes on the Mongolian Plateau and southern Siberia. In 1207 his eldest son Jochi subjugated the Siberian forest people, the Uriankhai, the Oirats, Barga, Khakas, Buryats, Tuvans, Khori-Tumed, and Kyrgyz.[7] He then organized the Siberians into three tumens. Genghis Khan gave the Telengit and Tolos along the Irtysh River to an old companion, Qorchi. While the Barga, Tumed, Buriats, Khori, Keshmiti, and Bashkirs were organized in separate thousands, the Telengit, Tolos, Oirats and Yenisei Kirghiz were numbered as tumens.[8] Genghis created a settlement of ethnic Han craftsmen and farmers at Kem-kemchik after the first phase of the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. The Great Khans favored gyrfalcons, furs, women and Kyrgyz horses for tribute.

Westlich Siberia came under the Golden Horde.[9] The descendants of Orda Khan, the eldest son of Jochi, direkt ruled the Bereich. In the swamps of westlich Siberia, dog sled Yam stations were set up to facilitate Sammlung of Tribut.

In 1270, Kublai Khan sent an ethnisch Han offiziell, with a neu batch of settlers, to serve as the judge of the Kyrgyz und Tuvan Einzugsgebiet areas (益蘭州 und 謙州).[10] Ögedei's Enkel Kaidu occupied portions of Zentral Siberia from 1275 on. The Yuan dynasty Armee under Kublai's Kipchak allgemein Tutugh reoccupied the Kyrgyz lands in 1293. From then on the Yuan Dynastie controlled groß portions of Zentral and Ost Siberia.[11]

The Yenisei Bereich had a Gemeinschaft of weavers of ethnisch Han Herkunft. Samarkand und Outer Mongolia beide had artisans of Han Herkunft.[12]

Novgorod und Muscovy
As früh as the 11th Jahrhundert the Novgorodians had gelegentlich penetrated in Siberia.[4] In the 14th Jahrhundert the Novgorodians explored the Kara Sea und the West Siberian Fluss Ob (1364).[13] Nach the fall of the Novgorod Republic its communications zwischen Northern Russia und Siberia were inherited by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. On May 9, 1483, the Moscow troops of Princes Feodor Kurbski-Cherny und Ivan Saltyk-Travin moved to West Siberia. The troops moved on the rivers Tavda, Tura, Irtysh, up to the Fluss Ob. In 1499 Muscovites und Novgorodians skied to West Siberia, up to the Fluss Ob, und conquered einige local tribes.[14]

Khanate of Sibir

The Khanate of Sibir in the 15th und 16th centuries
With the breakup of the Goldene Horde spät in the 15th Jahrhundert, the Khanate of Sibir was founded with its center at Tyumen. The non-Borjigin Taybughid Dynastie vied for Regel with the descendants of Shiban, a son of Jochi.

In the beginning of the 16th Jahrhundert Tatar fugitives from Turkestan subdued the locker associated tribes inhabiting the lowlands to the east of the Ural Mountains. Agriculturists, tanners, merchants, und mullahs (Muslim clerics) were brought from Turkestan, und small principalities sprang up on the Irtysh und the Ob. These were united by Khan Yadegar Mokhammad of Kazan.[citation needed] Conflicts with the Russians, who were then colonising the Urals, brought him in collision with Muscovy. Khan Yadegar's envoys came to Moscow in 1555 und consented to a Jährlich tribute of a Tausend sables.[15]

Yermak und the Cossacks
Haupt article: Russian conquest of Siberia

Yermak Timofeyevich
In the mid-16th Jahrhundert, the Tsardom of Russia conquered the Tatar khanates of Kazan und Astrakhan, also annexing the gesamte Volga Region und making the way to the Ural Mountains open. The colonisation of the neu easternmost lands of Russia und further onslaught eastward was led by the reich merchants Stroganovs. Tsar Ivan IV granted groß estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to Anikey Stroganov, who organized groß scale Migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, und ore mining on the Urals und established Handel with Siberian tribes.

In the 1570s, the Unternehmer Semyon Stroganov und other sons of Anikey Stroganov enlisted viele cossacks for Schutz of the Ural settlements gegen attacks by the Tatars of the Siberian Khanate, led by Khan Kuchum. Stroganov suggested to ihre chief Yermak, hired in 1577, to conquer the Khanate of Sibir, promising to help him with supplies of Lebensmittel und arms.

In 1581, Yermak began his voyage in the depths of Siberia with a Band of 1,636 men, following the Tagil und Tura Rivers. The following Jahr they were on the Tobol, und 500 men erfolgreich laid siege to Qashliq, the Aufenthalt of Khan Kuchum, near what is jetzt Tobolsk. Nach a wenig victories over the khan's Armee, Yermak's Menschen defeated the Haupt forces of Kuchum on Irtysh River nach a 3-day battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582. The remains of the khan's Armee retreated to the steppes, abandoning his domains to Yermak, who, according to Tradition, by presenting Siberia to tsar Ivan IV achieved his own Restaurierung to begünstigen.

Kuchum was immer noch strong und suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of Nacht, killing most of his Menschen. Yermak was wounded und tried to swim across the Wagay Fluss (Irtysh's Nebenfluss), but drowned under the Gewicht of his own chain mail. Yermak's Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia vollständig, but jede year neu bands of hunters und adventurers, supported by Moscow, poured in the Land. Thanks to Yermak's having explored alle the Haupt Fluss routes in West Siberia, Russians erfolgreich reclaimed alle of Yermak's conquests just mehrere years later.

Russian Erkundung and Siedlung
Haupt articles: Russian explorers und Siberian river routes

Siberian river routes were of primär Bedeutung in the Prozess of Russian exploration und conquest of Siberia.
In the früh 17th Jahrhundert, the eastward Bewegung of Russian Menschen was slowed by the intern problems in the Land during the Time of Troubles. Jedoch, very bald the Erkundung and colonization of the riesig territories of Siberia was resumed, led meist by Cossacks hunting for wertvoll furs und ivory. While Cossacks came from the Südlich Urals, eine andere wave of Russian Menschen came by the Arctic Ocean. These were Pomors from the Russian North, who had bereits been making fur Handel with Mangazeya in the Norden of the Westlich Siberia for ziemlich a lang time. In 1607 the Siedlung of Turukhansk was founded on the Norden Yenisey River, near the Mund of the Lower Tunguska, und in 1619 Yeniseysky ostrog was founded on the mid-Yenisey at the Mund of the Upper Tunguska.[16]

In 1620, a Gruppe of Pelz hunters led by the semi-legendary Demid Pyanda started out from Turukhansk on what would become a sehr protracted Reise. According to Volk tales related a Jahrhundert after the fact, in the drei und a half years from 1620 to 1624 Pyanda angeblich traversed the total of 4,950 miles (7,970 km) of hitherto unbekannt large Siberian rivers. He explored einige 1,430 miles (2,300 km) of the Lower Tunguska (Nizhnyaya Tunguska in Russian) und, having reached the obere part of the Tunguska, he came upon the great Siberian Fluss Lena und explored einige 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of its Länge. By doing this, he may have become the first Russian to reach Yakutia und meet Yakuts.[16] He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky und shallow, und by land reached Angara. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet Buryats. He built neu boats und explored einige 870 miles (1,400 km) of the Angara, schließlich reaching Yeniseysk und discovering that the Angara (a Buryat Name) and Upper Tunguska (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as ursprünglich known by the Russian Menschen) were one und the same Fluss.

In 1627, Pyotr Beketov was appointed Yenisey voevoda in Siberia. He erfolgreich carried out the voyage to collect taxes from Zabaykalye Buryats, becoming the first Russian to enter Buryatia. There he founded the first Russian Siedlung, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded Yakutsk und sent his Cossacks to explore the Aldan und further down the Lena, to found neu fortresses, und to collect taxes.[17]

Yakutsk bald turned in a Haupt base for weiter Russian expeditions eastward, southward und northward. Maksim Perfilyev, who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded Bratsky ostrog in 1631, und in 1638 he became the first Russian to enter Transbaikalia.[18][19] In 1639 a Gruppe led by Ivan Moskvitin became the first Russian to reach the Pacific Meer and to discover the Sea of Okhotsk, having built a Winter camp on its Landseite at the Ulya River Mund. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the Nähe of the Amur River.[16] In 1640 sie apparently sailed Süden, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Meer, maybe even reaching the Mund of the Amur River und discovering the Shantar Islands on ihre return voyage. Based on Moskvitin's account, Kurbat Ivanov draw the first Russian Karte of the Far East in 1642. He led a Gruppe of Cossacks selbst in 1643 to the Süden of the Baikal Mountains und discovered Lake Baikal, visiting its Olkhon Island. Anschließend, Ivanov made the first Karte and description of Baikal.[20]

In 1643, Vasily Poyarkov crossed the Stanovoy Range und reached the obere Zeya River in the Land of the Daurs, who were paying Tribut to Manchu Chinese. Nach wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya und became the first Russian to reach the Amur Fluss. He sailed down the Amur und finally discovered the Mund of that great Fluss from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals hinter, Poyarkov chose a verschiedene way back. Sie built boats und in 1645 sailed along the Sea of Okhotsk Küste to the Ulya River und spent the nächste winter in the huts that had been built by Ivan Moskvitin sechs years earlier. In 1646 sie returned to Yakutsk.[16]

In 1644, Mikhail Stadukhin discovered the Kolyma River und founded Srednekolymsk.[16] A Händler named Fedot Alekseyev Popov organized a weiter Expedition eastward, and Dezhnyov became a Kapitän of one of the kochi. In 1648 sie sailed from Srednekolymsk down to the Arctic und after einige Zeit they rounded Cape Dezhnyov, also becoming the first explorers to pass through Bering Strait und to discover Chukotka und the Bering Sea. Alle their kochi und most of ihre men (including Popov) were verloren in storms und clashes with the natives. A klein group led by Dezhnyov reached the Mund of the Anadyr River und sailed up it in 1649, having built neu boats out of the wreckage. Sie founded Anadyrsk und were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.[21] Later Stadukhin set off to the Süden in 1651 und discovered Penzhin Bay on the Norden side of the Okhotsk Sea. He auch may have explored the westlich shores of Kamchatka as früh as the 1650s.

In 1649–50, Yerofey Khabarov became the second Russian to explore the Amur River. Through the Olyokma, Tungur und Shilka Rivers he reached the Amur (Dauria), returned to Yakutsk und then went back to the Amur with a larger Kraft in 1650–53. This Zeit he was met with armed resistance. He built Winter quarters at Albazin, then sailed down the Amur und found Achansk, which preceded the present-day Khabarovsk, defeating oder evading groß armies of Daurian Manchu Chinese und Koreans on his way. He charted the Amur in his Entwurf of the Amur Fluss.[22][23]

In 1659–65, Kurbat Ivanov was the nächste head of Anadyrsky ostrog nach Semyon Dezhnyov. In 1660, he sailed from Anadyr Bay to Cape Dezhnyov. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, he is credited with Erstellung of the früh map of Chukotka und Bering Strait, which was the first to show on Papier (very schematically) the yet undiscovered Wrangel Island, beide Diomede Islands und Alaska.[19]

So, by the mid-17th Jahrhundert, the Russian Menschen had established the borders of ihre Land close to the modern ones, und explored fast the ganz of Siberia, außer eastern Kamchatka und some regions Norden of the Arctic Circle. The Eroberung of Kamchatka would be completed later, in the früh 18th Jahrhundert by Vladimir Atlasov, while the Entdeckung of the Arctic coastline und Alaska would be fast completed by the Great Northern Expedition in 1733–1743. The Expedition allowed cartographers to create a Karte of most of the Norden coastline of Russia, thanks to the results brought by a Serie of voyages led by Fyodor Minin, Dmitry Ovtsyn, Vasili Pronchishchev, Semyon Chelyuskin, Dmitry Laptev und Khariton Laptev. At the same Zeit, some of the members of the newly founded Russian Academy of Sciences traveled Ausführlich through Siberia, forming the so-called Akademisch Squad of the Expedition. Sie were Johann Georg Gmelin, Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt und others, who became the first wissenschaftlich explorers of Siberia.

Russian Menschen and Siberian natives

Siberian peoples as depicted in the 17th Jahrhundert Remezov Chronicle.
The Haupt Schatz to attract Cossacks to Siberia was the Pelz of sables, foxes, und ermines. Explorers brought back viele furs from ihre expeditions. Lokal people, submitting to the Russian Imperium, received defense from the südlich nomads. In Austausch they were obliged to pay yasak (tribute) in the Formular of furs. There was a set of yasachnaya roads, used to transportieren yasak to Moscow.

A number of peoples showed open Widerstand to Russian Menschen. Others submitted und even requested to be subordinated, though manchmal they later refused to pay yasak, oder not admitted to the Russian Behörde.[24]

There is evidence of Zusammenarbeit und assimilation of Russian Menschen with the lokal peoples in Siberia.[25] Though the mehr Russian Menschen advanced to the East, the weniger developed the lokal people were, und the mehr resistance sie offered. In 1607–1610, the Tungus fought strenuously for ihre independence, aber were subdued around 1623.[4] The Buryats auch offered einige opposition, aber were schnell pacified. The most Widerstand was offered by the Koryak (on the Kamchatka Peninsula) und Chukchi (on the Chukchi Peninsula), the letztere still being at the Stone Age Ebene of Entwicklung.[26] Widerstand by lokal people may have been the Ergebnis of forced unfair terms, that recorders would have benefitted from omitting.

The Manchu resistance, jedoch, obliged the Russian Cossacks to quit Albazin, und by the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) Russia abandoned her Vorschuss into the Einzugsgebiet of the Fluss, instead concentrating on the colonisation of the weit expanses of Siberia und trading with China via the Siberian trakt. In 1852, a Russian Militär expedition under Nikolay Muravyov explored the Amur, und by 1857 a Kette of Russian Cossacks und peasants were settled along the ganz course of the Fluss. The accomplished fact was recognised by China in 1860 by the Treaty of Aigun.[4]

Scientists in Siberia
The wissenschaftlich exploration of Siberia, commenced in the Zeitraum of 1720 to 1742 by Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt, Johann Georg Gmelin, und Louis de l'Isle de la Croyère, was followed up by Gerhard Friedrich Müller, Johann Eberhard Fischer, und Johann Gottlieb Georgi. Peter Simon Pallas, with mehrere Russian students, laid the first Stiftung of a gründlich exploration of the topography, fauna, flora, und inhabitants of the Land. The journeys of Christopher Hansteen und Georg Adolf Erman were the most wichtig step in the Erkundung of the Gebiet. Alexander von Humboldt, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, und Gustav Rose auch paid kurz visits to Siberia, which gave a neu impulse to the accumulation of wissenschaftlich knowledge; while Carl Ritter elaborated in his Asien (1832–1859) the foundations of a Klang knowledge of the Struktur of Siberia. Aleksandr Fyodorovich Middendorf's Reise (1843–1845) to north-eastern Siberia — contemporaneous with Matthias Castrén's journeys for the Spezial study of the Ural-Altaic languages — directed Achtung to the weit north und awakened interest in the Amur, the Einzugsgebiet of which bald became the Szene of the expeditions of Akhte und Schwarz (1852), und later on of the Siberian Expedition, advanced Wissen of East Siberia.[4]

The Siberian Zweigstelle of the Russian Geographical Society was founded at the same Zeit in Irkutsk, und afterwards became a dauerhaft centre for the Erkundung of Siberia; while the opening of the Amur und Sakhalin attracted Richard Maack, Schmidt, Glehn, Gustav Radde, und Leopold von Schrenck, who created works on the flora, fauna, und inhabitants of Siberia.[4]

Russian Siedlung

Siberia in 1636

The 17th-century Turm of Yakutsk fort.
In the 17th und 18th centuries, the Russian Menschen that migrated in Siberia were hunters, und those who had escaped from Zentral Russia: fugitive peasants in search for life kostenlos of serfdom, fugitive convicts, und Old Believers. The neu settlements of Russian Menschen and the existing lokal peoples required Verteidigung from nomads, for which forts were founded. This way forts of Tomsk und Berdsk were founded.

In the beginning of the 18th Jahrhundert, the Bedrohung of the nomads' attacks weakened; thus the region became more and more populated; normal civic life was established in the cities.

In the 18th Jahrhundert in Siberia, a neu administrative guberniya was formed with Irkutsk, then in the 19th Jahrhundert the Gebiet was mehrere times re-divided with Erstellung of neu guberniyas: Tomsk (with center in Tomsk) und Yenisei (Yeniseysk, later Krasnoyarsk).

In 1730, the first groß industrial Projekt — the metallurgical Produktion found by Demidov Familie — gave Geburt to the Stadt of Barnaul. Later, the Unternehmen organized sozial institutions like Bibliothek, club, Theater. Pyotr Semenov-Tyan-Shansky, who stayed in Barnaul in 1856–1857, wrote: "The richness of mining engineers of Barnaul expressed not lediglich in ihre households und clothes, aber more in ihre educational Ebene, knowledge of Wissenschaft and Literatur. Barnaul was undoubtedly the most cultured place in Siberia, und I've called it Siberian Athenes, leaving Sparta for Omsk".[27]

The same events took place in andere cities; öffentlich libraries, museums of lokal lore, colleges, theatres were being built, obwohl the first Universität in Siberia was opened as spät as 1880 in Tomsk.

Siberian peasants mehr than those in European Russia relied on ihre own Kraft und abilities. Sie had to fight gegen the harder Klima without outside help. Abwesenheit of serfdom und landlords auch contributed to ihre independent Zeichen. Im Gegensatz zu peasants in European Russia, Siberians had no problems with land Verfügbarkeit; the niedrig population Dichte gave them the Fähigkeit to intensively cultivate a Grundstück for mehrere years in a Zeile, then to leave it fallow for a lang time und cultivate andere plots. Siberian peasants had an Reichtum of Lebensmittel, while Zentral Russian peasantry had to mäßig their families' appetites. Leonid Blummer noted that the Kultur of Alkohol consumption differed deutlich; Siberian peasants drank häufig but moderately: "For a Siberian Wodka isn't a Wunder, unlike for a Russian Bauer, which, having reached it schließlich this Zeit, is bereit to drink a Meer." The houses, according to travellers' notes, were unlike the typisch Russian izbas: the houses were groß, often two-floored, the ceilings were high, the walls were covered with boards und painted with oil-paint.[28][29]

Russian Imperium
Verwaltung divisions

1905 Karte of Siberia
The Siberia Governorate was established in 1708 as Teil of the administrative reforms of Peter I. In 1719, the governorate was divided in three provinces, Vyatka, Solikamsk und Tobolsk. In 1762, it was renamed to Tsardom of Siberia (Сибирское царство). In 1782, under the Abdruck of Pugachev's Rebellion, the Siberian kingdom was divided in three separate viceregencies (наместничество), centered at Tobolsk, Irkutsk und Kolyvan. These viceregencies were downgraded to the Status of governorate in 1796 (Tobolsk Governorate, Irkutsk Governorate, Vyatka Governorate). Tomsk Governorate was split off Tobolsk governorate in 1804. Yakutsk Oblast was split off Irkutsk Governorate in 1805. In 1822, the subdivision of Siberia was reformed wieder. It was divided in two governorates allgemein, West Siberia und East Siberia. West Siberia comprised the Tobolsk und Tomsk governorates, und East Siberia comprised Irkutsk Governorate, und the newly formed Yeniseysk Governorate.

Decembrists und other exiles
Siberia was deemed a gut place to exile for politisch reasons, as it was weit from any Ausland country. A St. Petersburg Bürger would not wish to escape in the weit Siberian Landleben as the peasants und criminals did. Even the larger cities wie as Irkutsk, Omsk, und Krasnoyarsk, lacked that intensiv social life und luxurious high life of the Kapital.

About achtzig people involved in the Decembrist revolt were sentenced to obligatorisch work in Siberia und perpetual Siedlung here. Elf wives followed them und settled near the Arbeit camps. In ihre memoirs, sie noted benevolence und prosperity of ländlich Siberians und severe Behandlung by the soldiers und officers.

"Travelling through Siberia, I was wondered und fascinated at jede step by the cordiality und hospitality I met überall. I was fascinated by the richness und the Reichtum, with which the Menschen live until heute (1861), aber that Zeit there was even mehr expanse in everything. The Gastfreundschaft was besonders developed in Siberia. Überall wir were received like being in freundlich countries, überall wir were fed well, und when I asked wie viel I owed them, sie didn't want to take anything, saying "Put a Kerze to the Gott"."
"...Siberia is an extrem rich Land, the land is unusually fruitful, und little work is needed to get a plentiful ernten."
Polina Annenkova, Notes of a Decembrist's Frau[30]

A number of Decembrists died of diseases, einige suffered psychologisch shock und even went out of ihre mind.

Nach completing the term of obligatorisch work, sie were sentenced to settle in spezifisch small towns und villages. There, einige started doing business, which was well permitted. Nur several years later, in the 1840s, sie were allowed to move to groß cities oder to settle überall in Siberia. Nur in 1856, 31 years nach the Aufstand, Alexander II pardoned und restituted the Decembrists in Ehre of his coronation.

Living in the cities of Omsk, Krasnoyarsk, und Irkutsk, the Decembrists contributed Ausführlich to the sozial life und culture. In Irkutsk, ihre houses are jetzt museums. In viele places, Gedenkstätte plaques with ihre names have been installed.

Yet, there were exceptions: Vladimir Raevskiy was arrested for participation in Decembrists' circles in 1822, und in 1828 was exiled to Olonki Dorf near Irkutsk. There he married und had neun children, traded with Brot, and founded a Schule for children und adults to teach arithmetics und grammar. Being pardoned by Alexander II, he visited his einheimische town, aber returned to Olonki.

Trotz the wishes of the zentral authorities, the exiled revolutioners unwahrscheinlich felt outcast in Siberia. Ziemlich the gegen, Siberians having lived alle the Zeit on ihre own, "didn't feel Zärtlichkeit" to the authorities. In viele cases, the exiled were cordially received und got paid positions.[28]

Fyodor Dostoevsky was exiled to katorga near Omsk und to Militär service in Semipalatinsk. In the Dienstleistung he auch had to make trips for Barnaul und Kuznetsk, where he married.

Anton Chekhov was not exiled, aber in 1890 made a trip on his own to Sakhalin through Siberia und visited a katorga there. In his trip, he visited Tomsk, speaking disapprovingly about it, then Krasnoyarsk, which he called "the most schön Siberian Stadt". He noted that trotz being mehr a place of kriminell rather than politisch exile, the moralisch atmosphere was viel better: he did not face any case of Diebstahl. Blummer suggested to prepare a Waffe, but his attendant replied: What for?! Wir are not in Italy, you know. Chekhov observed that neben of the Offensichtlich prosperity, there was an dringend demand for Kultur development.[28]

Viele Poles were auch exiled to Siberia (see Sybirak). In 1866 sie incited rebellion in Siberia.

Trans-Siberian Eisenbahn
Haupt article: Trans-Siberian Railway

Crossing the Angara at Irkutsk (1886).
The Entwicklung of Siberia was hampered by poor Transport links innerhalb the Region as well as zwischen Siberia und the rest of the Land. Beiseite from the Sibirsky trakt, gut roads suitable for wheeled transportieren were wenig and weit apart. For about fünf months of the Jahr, rivers were the Haupt means of Transport; during the kalt half of the Jahr, cargo und passengers travelled by horse-drawn sleds over the Winter roads, viele of which were the same rivers, jetzt ice-covered.

The first steamboat on the Ob, Nikita Myasnikov's Osnova, was launched in 1844; aber the früh starts were schwierig, and it was not until 1857 that steamboat shipping started developing in the Ob System in the serious way. Steamboats started operating on the Yenisei in 1863, on the Lena und Amur in the 1870s.

While the comparably Wohnung Western Siberia was mindestens Ziemlich well served by the gigantisch Ob–Irtysh–Tobol–Chulym river System, the mächtig rivers of Ost Siberia – Yenisei, Upper Angara (Angara below Bratsk was not einfach navigable because of the rapids), Lena — were meist navigable nur in the Norden–south direction. An attempt to somewhat Abhilfe the Lage by Gebäude the Ob–Yenisei Canal were not insbesondere successful. Nur a railroad could be a real solution to the region's Transport problems.

The first projects of railroads in Siberia emerged since the Erstellung of the Moscow–St. Petersburg railroad. One of the first was Irkutsk–Chita Projekt, intended to connect the ehemals to the Amur Fluss and, folglich, to the Pacific Meer.

Vor to 1880 the zentral government Selten responded to wie projects, fällig to Schwäche of Siberian enterprises, Angst of Siberian territories' integration with the Pacific region rather than with Russia, and also falling under the influence of the United States und Great Britain. The schwer and clumsy Bürokratie and the Angst of Finanzen risks auch contributed to the inaction: the Finanzen system immer underestimated the effects of the Eisenbahn, assuming that it would take nur the existing Verkehr.

Hauptsächlich the Angst of losing Siberia convinced Alexander II in 1880 to make a Entscheidung to build the Eisenbahn. Konstruktion started in 1891.

Trans-Siberian Railroad gave a great erhöhen to Siberian Landwirtschaft, allowing for increased exports to Zentral Russia und European countries. It pushed not nur the territories closest to the Eisenbahn, but auch those connected with meridional rivers, wie as the Ob (Altai) und the Yenisei (Minusinsk und Abakan regions).


Tomsk was the largest Siberian Stadt by the end of the 19th Jahrhundert, but was left beiseite of the Trans-Siberian Eisenbahn.
Siberian Landwirtschaft exported a lot of billig grain to the West. The Landwirtschaft in Zentral Russia was immer noch under pressure of serfdom, formally abandoned in 1861. Eine andere profitable Industrie is the fur trade, which contributed sehr to the national revenue obenauf of covering Verwaltung costs in Siberia.[31]

Also, to defend it und to prevent möglich social destabilization, in 1896 (when the Ost and westlich parts of the Trans-Siberian did not close up yet), the Regierung introduced Chelyabinsk tariff break (Челябинский тарифный перелом)—a tariff Barriere for Getreide in Chelyabinsk, und a ähnlich barrier in Manchuria. This measure changed the Formular of Müsli product export: mills emerged in Altai, Novosibirsk, und Tomsk; viele farms switched to butter Produktion. From 1896 to 1913 Siberia on Durchschnitt exported 30.6 Million poods (~500,000 tonnes) of Müsli products (grain, Mehl) annually.[32]

Stolypin's resettlement Programm
One früh bedeutend settlement campaign was carried out under Nicholas II by Premierministerin Stolypin in 1906–1911.

The ländlich areas of Zentral Russia were overcrowded, while the East was immer noch lightly populated trotz having fertile lands. On May 10, 1906, by the Erlass of the Tsar, agriculturalists were granted the right to transfer, ohne any restrictions, to the Asian territories of Russia, und to obtain billig or kostenlos land. A groß advertising Kampagne was conducted: sechs million copies of brochures und banners entitled What the resettlement gives to peasants, und How the peasants in Siberia live were printed und distributed in ländlich areas. Spezial propaganda trains were sent throughout the Landleben, and transportieren trains were provided for the migrants. The Staat gave loans to the settlers for Bauernhof construction.

Not alle the settlers decided to stay; 17.8% migrated back. Alle in alle, more than drei million Menschen officially resettled to Siberia, und 750,000 came as foot-messengers. From 1897 to 1914 Siberian Bevölkerung increased 73%, und the Bereich of land under Anbau doubled.[33]

Tunguska Veranstaltung
Haupt article: Tunguska event
The Tunguska Veranstaltung, or Tunguska Explosion, was a leistungsstarke explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya (Lower Stony) Tunguska Fluss in what is jetzt Krasnoyarsk Krai of Russia, at around 7:14 a.m.[34] (0:14 UT, 7:02 a.m. lokal solar Zeit[35]) on June 30, 1908 (June 17 in the Julian calendar, in use vor Ort at the Zeit).[35]

The verursachen of the Explosion is umstritten, and immer noch much disputed to this Tag. Obwohl the verursachen of the Explosion is the Thema of Debatte, it is allgemein believed to have been caused by a meteor air burst: the atmosphärisch explosion of a groß meteoroid oder comet Fragment at an altitude of 5–10 kilometres (3.1–6.2 miles) above the Earth's Oberfläche. Verschiedene studies have yielded varying estimates of the object's Größe, with allgemein agreement that it was a wenig tens of metres across.[36]

Obwohl the Tunguska Veranstaltung is believed to be the largest impact event on land in Earth's recent Geschichte,[37] impacts of ähnlich size in remote ocean areas would have gone unnoticed vor the advent of weltweit satellite monitoring in the 1960s und 1970s. Because the Veranstaltung occurred in a remote area, there was wenig damage to menschlich life oder property, und it was in der Tat einige years until it was richtig investigated.

The first recorded Expedition arrived at the Szene more than a Jahrzehnt after the Veranstaltung. In 1921, the Russian mineralogist Leonid Kulik, visiting the Podkamennaya Tunguska Fluss basin as Teil of a survey for the Soviet Academy of Sciences, deduced from lokal accounts that the Explosion had been caused by a riesig meteorite impact. He persuaded the Soviet Regierung to fund an Expedition to the Tunguska Region, based on the prospect of meteoric iron that could be salvaged to Hilfe Soviet Industrie.

Kulik's party reached the Website in 1927. To ihre surprise, no crater was to be found. There was stattdessen a Region of scorched trees about 50 kilometres (31 mi) across. A wenig near ground zero were immer noch Seltsamerweise standing upright, ihre branches und bark stripped off. Those farther away had been knocked down in a direction away from the center.

Russian Zivil War
For mehr detailed chronology of the zivil war in Siberia, see Siberian separatism. For Aleksandr Kolchak, see Siberian Intervention.
By the Zeit of the revolution Siberia was an Landwirtschaft region of Russia, with schwach entrepreneur und industrial classes. The intelligentsia had vage political ideas. Nur 13%[38] of the region's Bevölkerung lived in the cities und possessed einige political Wissen. The lack of stark social differences und scarcity of urban population und intellectuals led to the uniting of formell different politisch parties under ideas of regionalism.[39]

The anti-Bolshevik forces failed to offer a united Widerstand. While Kolchak fought gegen the Bolsheviks intending to eliminate them in the Kapital of the Imperium, the lokal Socialist-Revolutionaries und Mensheviks tried to sign a Frieden treaty with the Bolsheviks, on terms of Unabhängigkeit. Ausland allies, though being able to make a entscheidend effort, preferred to stay neutral, although Kolchak selbst rejected the offer of help from Japan.[40][41][42]

Nach a Serie of defeats in Zentral Russia, Kolchak's forces retreated to Siberia. Amid Widerstand of Socialist-Revolutionaries und waning Unterstützung from the allies, the Whites had to evacuate from Omsk to Irkutsk, und finally Kolchak resigned under pressure of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who bald submitted to the Bolsheviks.

Soviet Ära

Ethnographic Karte of the Soviet Gewerkschaft, 1970
1920s und 1930s
By the 1920s the Landwirtschaft in Siberia was in decline. With the groß number of immigrants, land was used sehr intensively, which led to exhaustion of the land und frequent schlecht harvests.[43] Landwirtschaft wasn't destroyed by the zivil war, aber the disorganization of the exports destroyed the Lebensmittel industry und reduced the peasants' incomes. Außerdem, prodrazvyorstka und then the natürlich food tax contributed to growing discontent. In 1920–1924 there was a number of anti-communistic riots in ländlich areas, with up to 40,000 Menschen involved.[44] Beide old Whites (Cossacks) und old "Reds" partisans, who earlier fought gegen Kolchak, the marginals, who were the Haupt force of the Communists, took Teil in the riots. According to a survey of 1927 in Irkutsk Oblast, the peasants offen said sie would participate in anti-Soviet rebellion und hoped for Ausland help.[45] In 1929, one such anti-Soviet rebellion took place in Buryatia, the rebellion was put down will the deaths of 35,000 Buryats. It should auch be noticed that the KVZhD builders und workers were declared enemies of the people by a special order of the Soviet authorities.

The Jugend, that had socialized in the age of Krieg, was highly militarized, und the Soviet Regierung pushed the weiter military Propaganda by Komsomol. There are viele documented evidences of "red banditism", besonders in the Landleben, such as desecration of churches und Christian graves, und even murders of priests und believers. Auch in viele cases a Komsomol Aktivist or an Behörde representative, speaking with a Person opposed to the Soviets, got wütend and killed him/her und anybody sonst. The Party faintly counteracted this.[45]

In the 1930s, the Party started the collectivization, which automatisch put the "kulak" Etikett on the well-off families living in Siberia for a lang time. Natürlich, raskulachivanie applied to alle who protested. From the Zentral Russia viele families were exiled to low-populated, Wald or swampy areas of Siberia, aber those who lived hier, had either to escape überall, or to be exiled in the Norden regions (such as Evenk und Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrugs und the Norden parts of Tomsk Oblast). Collectivization destroyed the traditionell and most wirksam stratum of the peasants in Siberia und the natürlich ways of Entwicklung, and its consequences are immer noch persisting.[46]

In the cities, während the New Economic Policy und later, the neu authorities, driven by the romantisch socialistic ideas made attempts to build neu socialistic cities, according to the modisch constructivism Bewegung, but schließlich have left nur numbers of square houses. Zum Beispiel, the Novosibirsk theatre was ursprünglich designed in rein constructivistic Stil. It was an ehrgeizig project of exiled architects. In the mid-1930s with Einführung of new classicism, it was deutlich redesigned.

Nach the Trans-Siberian was built, Omsk bald became the largest Siberian Stadt, but in 1930s Soviets favoured Novosibirsk. In the 1930s the first schwer industrialization took place in the Kuznetsk Basin (coal mining und ferrous metallurgy) und at Norilsk (nickel und rare-earth metals). The Northern Sea Route saw Industrie application. At the same Zeit, with growing number of prisoners, Gulag established a groß network of Arbeit camps in Siberia.

Welt War II
In 1941, viele enterprises und people were evacuated in Siberian cities by the railroads. In dringend need of ammunition und military Ausrüstung, they started working fast immediately nach their materials und equipment were unloaded.

Most of the evacuated enterprises remained at ihre new sites nach the Krieg. Sie increased Industrie production in Siberia to a great Umfang, and became constitutive for viele cities, like Rubtsovsk. The easternmost Stadt to receive them was Ulan-Ude, since Chita was considered dangerously close to China und Japan.

On August 28, 1941, the Oberste Soviet stated an Bestellung "About the Resettlement of the Germans of Volga region", by which viele of them were deported in different ländlich areas of Kazakhstan und Siberia.

By the end of Krieg, thousands of captive soldiers und officers of German und Japanese armies were sentenced to mehrere years of work in Arbeit camps in alle the regions of Siberia. These camps were directed by a verschiedene administration than Gulag. Obwohl Soviet camps hadn't the Zweck to lead prisoners to Tod, the Tod rate was bedeutend, especially in winters. The Bereich of works differed from Gemüse farming to Konstruktion of the Baikal Amur Mainline.

Industrie expansion

Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric powerstation
In the second halb of the 20th Jahrhundert, the Erkundung of Mineralien and hydroenergetic resources continued. Viele of these projects were planned, aber were delayed fällig to wars und the ever-changing opinions of Soviet politicians.

The most berühmt project is the Baikal Amur Mainline. It was planned gleichzeitig with Trans-Siberian, aber the Konstruktion began just vor Welt Krieg II, was put on halten during the Krieg and restarted nach. Nach Joseph Stalin's Tod, it was wieder suspended for years to be continued under Leonid Brezhnev.

A cascade of hydroelectric powerplants was built in the 1960s–1970s on the Angara River, a Projekt similar to Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. The powerplants allowed Erstellung and Unterstützung of groß production facilities, wie as the Aluminium plant in Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk, rare-earth mining in Angara Einzugsgebiet, and those associated with the Holz industry. The price of Strom in Angara Einzugsgebiet is the lowest in Russia. Aber the Angara cascade is not vollständig finished yet: the Boguchany power plant waits to be finished, und a Serie of enterprises are planned to be set up.

The downside of this Entwicklung is ökologisch Schaden due to niedrig standards of Produktion and Übermäßige sizes of dams (the bigger projects were favoured by Industrie authorities und received mehr funding), the increased humidity sharpened the bereits hard Klima. Eine andere powerplant Projekt on Katun River in Altai mountains in the 1980s, which was Weithin protested öffentlich, was cancelled.

There are a number of military-oriented centers like the NPO Vektor und closed cities like Seversk. By the end of the 1980s a groß portion of the Industrie production of Omsk und Novosibirsk (up to 40%) was composed of Militär und aviation output. The zusammenbrechen of state-funded Militär orders began an wirtschaftlich crisis.


Akademgorodok, a wissenschaftlich town near Novosibirsk
The Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences unites a lot of Forschung institutes in the biggest cities, the biggest being the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Akademgorodok (a wissenschaftlich town) near Novosibirsk. Andere scientific towns oder just districts composed by Forschung institutes, auch named "Akademgorodok", are in the cities of Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk und Irkutsk. These sites are the centers of the newly developed IT Industrie, especially in that of Novosibirsk, nicknamed "Silicon Taiga", und in Tomsk.

A number of Siberian-based companies extended ihre businesses of verschiedene consumer products to meta-regional und an All-Russian Ebene. Verschiedene Siberian artists und industries, have created communities that are not centralized in Moscow mehr, like the Idee[47] (jährlich low-budged ads festival), Goldene Capital[48] (annual Preis in Architektur).

Recent Geschichte

A neu (2003) Wohnung building in Novosibirsk
Until Fertigstellung of the Chita–Khabarovsk Autobahn, the Transbaikalia was a dead end for automobile transportieren. While this kürzlich constructed through Straße will anfangs profitieren mostly the Transit travel to und from the Pacific provinces, it will auch boost Siedlung and Industrie expansion in the sparsely populated regions of Zabaykalsky Krai und Amur Oblast.

Erweiterung of Transport networks will continue to define the directions of Siberian regional development. The nächste project to be carried out is the Fertigstellung of the railroad Zweigstelle to Yakutsk. Eine andere large Projekt, proposed bereits in the 19th Jahrhundert as a Norden option for the Transsiberian railroad, is the Northern-Siberian Railroad zwischen Nizhnevartovsk, Belyi Yar, Lesosibirsk und Ust-Ilimsk. The Russian Railroads stattdessen suggest an ehrgeizig project of a Eisenbahn to Magadan, Chukchi Halbinsel and then the angeblich Bering Strait Tunnel to Alaska.

While the Russians continue to migrate from the Siberian und Far Eastern Federal Districts to Westlich Russia, the Siberian cities attract Arbeit (legal oder illegal) from the Zentral Asian republics und from China. While the natives are bewusst of the Lage, in Westlich Russia myths about thousands and millions of Chinese living in the Transbaikalia und the Weit East are weit verbreitet.[49]

The largest Forschung center in Russia, which systematisch studies the history of Siberia, is Institute of History of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of SciencesГлавная.

Stehend Stein State Park is a state park in Overton County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The park consists of 855 acres (3.46 km2) along the shoreline of the menschengemacht 69-acre (0.28 km2) Stehend Stone See. The 11,000-acre (45 km2) Stehend Stein State Forest surrounds the park.[1]

The park und forest were developed in the 1930s as Teil of New Deal-era initiatives to relocate impoverished farmers und restore forests from degraded und heavily eroded lands. The park was named nach the Stehend Stone, a geheimnisvoll rock believed to be of Native American Herkunft or Bedeutung that once stood along the alt Walton Straße at what is jetzt Monterey. The park offers canoeing, camping, lodging, hiking und many andere activities.

Geografische setting
Stehend Stein State Park is situated atop the Ost section of the Highland Rim, a plateau-like upland that surrounds the Nashville Basin. The park is located etwa halfway zwischen the rim's edge along the Einzugsgebiet to the West and the higher Cumberland Plateau to the east. The Dale Hollow Lake impoundment of the Obey River dominates the Bereich just a wenig miles to the Norden.


Stehend Stein State Forest in December, looking northeast from the Goodpasture Berg Firetower
Mühle Creek, the park's Haupt stream, flows down from its Quelle on Reynolds Berg (near Allons) to the east und winds its way westward through the hills of northern Overton County before emptying in the Cumberland River. At Stehend Stein State Park, the steil ridge upon which the park's Haupt facilities are located kurz pushes the westward-flowing Mühle Creek southward through a horseshoe bend. At this bend, two of Mühle Creek's tributaries, Morgan Creek und Bryans Gabel, join Mühle Creek at the Südost and Südwest, respectively, to Formular a natürlich X-shaped Körper of Wasser. Stehend Stone Damm impounds the creek sofort downstream from the bend, forming the X-shaped Stehend Stone See. Ridges und high hills rise above the See on alle sides, nämlich 1,455-foot (443 m) Cooper Berg to the east and 1,493-foot (455 m) Goodpasture Berg to the Südwest.

Tennessee State Route 136, which runs north-to-south, traverses Stehend Stein State Park. The Straße intersects the east-west Tennessee State Route 85 at the Gemeinschaft of Hilham just Süden of the park und intersects the east-west Tennessee State Route 52 just Norden of the park. Jenseits von Hilham, SR 136 continues southward to Cookeville, where it intersects Interstate 40. The Stadt of Livingston, where SR 52 und SR 85 intersect, is just Südost of the park.

Stehend Stein State Forest

Hardwood Wald along the crest of Cooper Berg
Stehend Stein State Park is surrounded by Stehend Stein State Forest, which is managed by the Tennessee Abteilung of Forestry. Im Gegensatz zu the Staat park, the Staat forest does not have recreational facilities, obwohl public Zugang is permitted. The Grenze between the Staat forest und state park is eindeutig marked with signs, blazes, oder ribbons.

When the United States Department of Agriculture acquired the land for Stehend Stein State Forest in the 1930s, the Wald had been damaged und depleted by Wald fires, logging, und poor farming practices wie as Zeile cropping. Stehend Stone was designated a Staat forest in 1961, sechs years nach the U.S. Regierung officially deeded the land to the Staat of Tennessee. The Wald consists of 89% upland hardwoods, 6.8% Kiefer, and 4% mixed hardwood und pine. 34% of the trees in the Wald are over 80 years alt, 48% are zwischen 50 und 80 years alt, und 18% are less than 50 years alt.[2]

Geschichte
Native Americans were living in Wesentlich semi-permanent villages und rock shelters in Norden Overton Landkreis as früh as the Archaic period (c. 8000-1000 BC).[3][4] According to Einheimische American legends, the Overton Bereich was Teil of a weit region lang disputed by Algonquian-speaking tribes (such as the Shawnee) und Iroquoian-speaking tribes (such as the Cherokee).[5] By the Zeit the first Euro-American explorers arrived in Overton Landkreis in the mid-18th Jahrhundert, the Cherokee were in Kontrolle of the Bereich. The Cherokee Chef Nettle Träger operated out of a Lager located along the creek that jetzt bears his Name a wenig miles east of the park. Nettle Träger left the Bereich in the Fall of 1799.[6]

Long hunters, who were among the first Euro-Americans to explore the Mitte Tennessee Region, were aktiv in the Stehend Stone Bereich as früh as the 1760s.[7] These hunters were drawn to the Region by the Cumberland Fluss, the headwaters of which sie followed westward from Virginia. Daniel Boone und Richard Callaway are believed to have camped at the Mund of Mühle Creek around 1763.[8] A wenig years later, a lang hunting Expedition led by Kasper Mansker camped in the Eiche Hill Bereich, near modern Livingston. While at Eiche Hill, a Mitglied of Mansker's Expedition named Robert Crockett was ambushed und killed by feindliche Cherokees.[9]

The park's namesake was a geheimnisvoll stone which according to the region's earliest pioneers was revered by Einheimische Americans. William Walton discovered the Stein at what is jetzt Monterey (appx. 20 miles (32 km) southeast of the park) in the spät 1780s while Gebäude the Walton Straße. The Stein originally stood around 10 feet (3.0 m) groß and was shaped like a Hund sitting on its hind legs. The Zweck of the Stein, if any, remains unbekannt. Einige accounts Anspruch that the Stein marked the Grenze between the territories of the Cherokee und Shawnee, oder other Einheimische American tribes. Others say it was a guidepost used by Cherokee hunting parties. Whatever its Original purpose, the Stein was a bekannt landmark for migrants travelling zwischen East und Middle Tennessee in the früh 19th Jahrhundert. A Gemeinschaft known as "Stehend Stone" (later renamed Monterey) developed along the Walton Straße in the stone's Umgebung. The Stehend Stone was dynamited in 1893 to make way for railroad Konstruktion. In Kürze after it was destroyed, a lokal society bekannt as the Improved Bestellung of the Redmen retrieved und preserved mehrere pieces of the Stein. In 1895, the Bestellung placed one of these pieces (which sie had engraved) atop a Denkmal at Monterey Stadt Park, where it remains heute.[10]

Entwicklung of the park
Stehend Stein State Park was one of a Serie of New Deal-era projects of the Works Project Administration und the Resettlement Administration aimed at relocating impoverished farmers living on schlecht eroded lands und restoring the forests to these lands. Work began in 1935 with a three-fold Zweck— relocating farmers in the Mühle Creek Bereich, restoring the Wald and controlling erosion, und creating recreational opportunities for Bereich residents. The work was carried out by the Resettlement Verwaltung, the WPA, und the Civilian Conservation Corps under the allgemein supervision of the United States Forest Service. The land was leased to the Tennessee Abteilung of Staat Parks in 1939.[11]

Während World War II, Entwicklung was weitgehend halted und many of the park's facilities fell in disrepair. Nach the Krieg, the cabins were renovated, the See was drained und restocked with fish, und a Haupt leak in the Damm was repaired. The United States Abteilung of Landwirtschaft officially deeded the land to the Staat of Tennessee in 1955.[12]

Park facilities und events

Overton Lodge
Recreational facilities at Stehend Stein State Park include a 36-site campground, 21 cabins ranging from rustic to modern, four Gruppe lodges, an Olympic-size Pool, multiple Picknick areas, und an amphitheatre. Most of these facilities (along with the Besucher center) are located atop the steil ridge on the Norden shore of the See. The lone Ausnahme is Overton Lodge, one of the vier group lodges, which is located along the lake's east Landseite.

Over 8 miles (13 km) of hiking trails are maintained in the park und forest. The most beliebt trail is the See Trail, which descends from the Besucher center to Stehend Stone Damm and parallels most of the Norden shore of the See before reascending to the Kabine area. The most Wesentlich trail is the 8-mile (13 km) Cooper Berg Loop Pfad, which circles through mehrere miles of the Staat forest on the slopes of Cooper Berg before reentering the Staat park near Overton Lodge.

The National Rolley Loch Marbles Meisterschaft is held jede September at Stehend Stein State Park. Rolley Loch is a type of marbles game beliebt with marble enthusiasts in the Tennessee-Kentucky Region.[13] Andere annual events include the Spring Naturalist Rallye in April und the Stehend Stone Auto Show in October.

The Russian Naval Aviation (Russian: Авиация Военно-морского флота России, tr. Aviatsiya Voenno-morskovo Flota Rossii) is the air Arm of the Russian Navy, a Nachfolger of Soviet Naval Aviation. The Russian Navy is divided in vier fleets and one flotilla: Northern Fleet, Pacific Fleet, Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, und Caspian Flotilla.

The air forces of the largest und most wichtig fleets, the Norden and Pacific fleets, operate lang range Tu-142 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) Flugzeug, Il-38 medium-range ASW Flugzeug, and Ka-27 shipborne ASW und search-and-rescue (SAR) helicopters. Formations operating supersonic Tu-22M3 bombers were transferred to the Russian Air Force's Lang Range Aviation in 2011.[3] The relativ small fleets, the Baltic und Black Meer, currently have nur tactical Su-24 bombers und ASW helicopters in Dienstleistung.

The klein Caspian Flotilla operates An-26 und Mi-8 transports, Ka-27PS rescue helicopters, as well as einige Ka-29 und Mi-24 armed helicopters. In 2011, the Russian Navy Deputy Commander-in-Chief for Naval Aviation und Air Defense/Commander, Naval Air und Air Defense Forces is Major General Igor Kozhin.

Geschichte
Beginning
On May 30, 1912, the Vice-Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy, Vice-Admiral Alexander Karl Nikolai von Lieven submitted a geschrieben report No. 127 on the Plan for the Erstellung of aviation detachments in the fleets . This Dokument, approved with einige reservations by the Naval Minister Vice Admiral Ivan Grigorovich, acquired the Zeichen of an Bestellung for the Naval Ministerium. The logisch continuation of the Bericht was a letter from MGSh No. 1706/272 dated 06/02/1912 to the head of the Allgemein Mitarbeiter School on the Bildung of the Infrastruktur of aviation units in 1913.

As of January 1, 1913, there was one seaplane und two wheeled airplanes in the Baltic, und five seaplanes on the Schwarz Sea. In the spring of 1914, by the Entscheidung of the Minister of the Navy, an aviation Abteilung was introduced in the Mitarbeiter of the Naval Allgemein Staff, consisting of drei people.

Welt War I
The beginning of the World War I found the Russian Naval Aviation at the stage of organizational Bildung. Insgesamt, by August 1, 1914, the Naval Ministerium had about drei dozen Flugzeug of verschiedene types und about 20 certified pilots. About 10 mehr officers underwent flight training direkt in the fleets. By the beginning of the Krieg, there were nur 10 seaplanes in the Baltic, based in Libau, und 8 seaplanes in the Black Sea, in Sevastopol, und Kilen Bucht. It was planned to deploy air detachments in the Pacific Ocean nur by the Sommer of 1915, aber this was not implemented fällig to the Ausbruch of the Krieg.

At the beginning of March 1915, the Naval Aviation bereits had 77 Flugzeug, including 47 in the Baltic, und 30 seaplanes in the Schwarz Sea. Sie were served by 78 officers und 859 lower ranks. As of 1 January 1917, the Russian Naval Aviation was an beeindruckend force und included 264 airplanes of verschiedene types. Of these, 152 Flugzeug and 4 klein controlled balloons were in the Black Sea Fleet, 88 Flugzeug in the Baltic. Eine andere 29 Flugzeug were verfügbar in the Petrograd und Baku Offizier aviation schools.

From September 1916 to May 1917 allein, the Naval Abteilung received 61 Grigorovich M-11 und M-12 seaplanes. 26 of them flew in the Schwarz Sea, about 20 entered the Baltic. In the Schwarz Sea und Baltic aviation units, respectively, 115 und 96 officers, 1039 und 1339 conductors, non-commissioned officers und privates served.

Zivil War und interwar Zeitraum
The regelmäßig Soviet naval aviation units were created in 1918. Sie participated in the Russian Civil War, cooperating with the ships und the Armee during the combats at Petrograd, on the Baltic Sea, the Schwarz Sea, the Volga, the Kama River, Northern Dvina und on the Lake Onega. The newborn Soviet Naval Air Kraft consisted of 76 obsolete hydroplanes. Scanty und technically imperfect, it was meist used for resupplying the ships und the Armee.

In the second halb of the 1920s, the Naval Aviation Bestellung of Schlacht began to grow. It received neu reconnaissance hydroplanes, bombers, und fighters. In the mid-1930s, the Soviets created the Naval Air Kraft in the Baltic Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet und the Soviet Pacific Fleet. The Bedeutung of naval aviation had grown deutlich by 1938–1940, to become one of the Haupt components of the Soviet Navy. By this Zeit, the Soviets had created formations und units of the torpedo und bomb aviation. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, alle of the fleets (except for the Pacific Flotte) had a total of 1,445 Flugzeug.

Welt War II
Haupt article: Soviet Naval Aviation
At the end of June 1941, drei air squadrons of the Zivil Air Flotte (Baltic, Schwarz Sea, Norden) were formed from zivil aviation units (Baltic, Schwarz Sea, Norden), which were operatively subordinate to the command of the air forces of the jeweilige fleets. Ihre task was to provide transportieren services in the interests of the fleets. Darüber hinaus, from the first days of the Krieg, some aviation units of the NKVD Border Troops were transferred to the Naval Aviation. At the same Zeit, the first Angriff aviation units appeared in the Navy's Air Kraft: a squadron of the 57th BAP in the Baltic und the 46th OSHAE in the Schwarz Sea Flotte.

In the Great Patriotic War, the Naval Aviation turned out to be the most wirksam of the forces of the Flotte - the Zerstörung of 407 Feind ships by aviation was offiziell confirmed, which is 66% of losses, with a total number of losses - 614 units (however, there is Information that offiziell data on the Wirksamkeit of the work of meine and torpedo aviation, for a number of reasons, sie are sehr overestimated).

In the end of Welt War II, a Reduzierung in the Soviet Armed Forces began. In the Naval Aviation, nach the end of hostilities, Angriff aviation was vollständig eliminated, jedoch, three mehr aviation divisions were formed: the 17th Traurig and the 18th Traurig of the Pacific Flotte Air Kraft, as well as the 19th MTAD of the Navy's Haupt Command.

Kalt War Zeitraum
To attack Oberfläche ships at lang ranges, the Soviet Navy was einzigartig in deploying groß numbers of bombers in a maritim role for use by Naval Aviation. The Kiev class of Soviet Flugzeug carriers was deployed in the spät 1970s und carried up to 30 Flugzeug including Yak-38 VTOL fighters. The nächste class of Soviet Flugzeug carriers, named the Admiral Kuznetsov class, supported mehr conventional Flugzeug such as the Su-33 "Flanker-D" und the MiG-29 "Fulcrum".[4]

Land-based Flugzeug such as the Tupolev Tu-16 "Badger" und Tu-22M "Backfire" bombers were deployed with high-speed anti-ship missiles. Zuvor believed to be interceptors of NATO supply convoys traveling the sea lines of communication across the North Atlantic Ocean zwischen Europe und North America, the primär role of these Flugzeug was to protect the Soviet Festland from attacks by U.S. Träger task forces.[4]

Twenty-first Jahrhundert
Russian naval aviation participated in the Russian military intervention in the War in Syria for a wenig months from November 2016 to January 2017 with the Bereitstellung of Russian Admiral Kuznetsov carrier to the Mediterranean. This Bereitstellung to Syria auch marked the naval aviation's combat debut.[citation needed]

On 15 November 2016, Admiral Kuznetsov, took Teil in "a large-scale Operation against the positions of Terrorist groups Islamic State und Al-Nusra, in the provinces of Idlib und Homs" in Syria by launching Su-33 Kämpfer strikes. Russian Verteidigung Ministry later reported that mindestens 30 militants had been killed as a Ergebnis of those strikes, einschließend 3 Feld commanders, among them Abul Baha al-Asfari, Anführer of Al-Nusra reserves in the provinces of Homs und Aleppo. Al-Asfari had auch planned und led mehrere insurgent attacks on the Stadt of Aleppo itself. The Su-33s reportedly used 500 kg (1,100 lb) Präzision bombs.[5]

On 3 December 2016, an Su-33 crashed in the Meer nach attempting to land on the Admiral Kuznetsov. The Flugzeug crashed on its second attempt to land on the Flugzeug carrier in gut weather conditions. The Pilot was sicher recovered by a search und rescue Hubschrauber.[6] Ursprünglich it was suspected that the Flugzeug missed the wires und failed to go around, falling kurz of the bow of the warship, aber later it was revealed that the arresting Kabel failed to halten the Flugzeug, and was damaged in the attempt. Following the two incidents, the air Flügel was transferred to Landseite at Khmeimim Air Base near Latakia, Syria to continue Militär operations while the carrier's arresting Getriebe issues were addressed.[7]

Während her Bereitstellung off Syria, Flugzeug from Admiral Kuznetsov carried out 420 combat missions, hitting 1,252 feindliche targets.[8] On 11 January 2017, Admiral Kuznetsov was conducting live-fire training exercises in the Mediterranean off the Küste of Libya.[9] The Russian Verteidigung ministry announced that on 11 January, Admiral Kuznetsov was visited by Libya's Militär leader Khalifa Haftar, who had a video Konferenz with Russian Verteidigung minister Sergey Shoygu while on board.[10][11]

Ben-Zion, auch known as Ben-Zion Weinman (1897–1987)[2] was a Russian-born American Maler, printmaker, sculptor, educator, und poet. He was a Mitglied of "The Ten" Gruppe of expressionist artists.[2]

Früh life
Ben-Zion was born on July 8, 1897, in Starokostiantyniv, Russian Empire (present-day is Ukraine).[3] His Vater, Hirsch Weinman was a Jewish cantor, und initially he wanted to enter the rabbinate.[4][5] In 1909, the Familie moved to Galicia.[6] At age 17, he travelled to Vienna to study Kunst.[4] He had been rejected from entering the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna fällig to antisemitism.[4] Früh in his Karriere, he wrote fairy tales und poems in Hebrew under the Name "Benzion Weinman".[2]

Karriere
He immigrated to the United States in 1920 nach the Tod of his Vater, and started by teaching Hebrew Sprache.[2][4] When he started painting he dropped his last Name and started hyphenating.[2] His first groß scale painting was Friday Abend (1933), depicting his family's Sabbath Abendessen table.[4] Starting in 1935, viele of his paintings were expressionist versions of reinterpreted biblisch scenes.[1][4] His first solo exhibition was in 1936 at the Artists' Galerie in Neu York Stadt.[4][7] His früh artwork was hauptsächlich done in oil paint, watercolors, und intaglio printmaking.[1] He was weitgehend a self-taught Künstler.[1]

From 1936 until 1942, he was a founding Mitglied of "The Ten" expressionist Künstler group,[7] which auch included the artists Mark Rothko, Louis Harris (artist) [Wikidata], Adolph Gottlieb, Ralph Rosenborg, Louis Schanker, Joseph Solman, Nahum Tschacbasov, und Ilya Bolotowsky.[2][4] The Mission of the Kunst group was, "to Protest against the reputed equivalence of American painting und literal painting."[8]

From the 1930s to the 1960s, Ben-Zion taught Kunst (through the Works Progress Administration) at Cooper Union und other locations.[6]

In the 1950s, he began working in welded Eisen sculptures.[2] In 1959, the Jewish Museum in Neu York Stadt held a retrospective Ausstellung of his work.[7]

Tod and Erbe
Ben-Zion died on January 23, 1987, in Neu York Stadt.[2] He was survived by his Frau Lillian (née Dubin).[2]

Sargassum linearifolium is a species of braun macroalgae that is gemeinsame along the Küste of südlich Australia, though wahrscheinlich excluding Tasmania. The most Weithin distributed südlich Australian Arten of Sargassum. Oft common in Felsen pools oder the uppermost sublittoral areas on coasts where there is stark to mäßig water Bewegung. The original specimen's Ortschaft is wahrscheinlich to be King George Sound in Westlich Australia. This seaweed first appeared in wissenschaftlich literature as Fucus linearifolius in the Jahr 1808. Published by the English botanist Dawson Turner.[1][2][3][4]

Isyaman is an inland Dorf in Mappi Regency, South Papua, Indonesia.

Geschichte
At the Zeit of the Dutch Ankunft, the Mappi Region was inhabited by verschiedene tribes speaking Trans–New Guinea languages, wie as the Awyu, the Yaqay, oder the Kayagar.[2] The Einwohnerin of the Bereich were meist left allein by the outside Welt until the first halb of the 20th Jahrhundert, when the Dutch started taking an interest in the Region. In 1936, a Militär post bekannt as Mappi Post, was set up on a Hügel named Tamao at the confluence of the Digoel und Kawarga River near where the Dorf stands heute, in Bestellung to prevent Headhunting raids which were creating Unruhe and migrations, und assert Dutch Kontrolle over the Bereich.[3] Following the Japanese Invasion of New Guinea in 1942, und the nachfolgend low-level bombing of the post by Japanese Flugzeug, the Dutch fled in the in der Nähe jungle,[4] leaving the post nur occupied by a coastwatcher. In June 1944, the Australian Army moved in, installing a radar Bahnhof which had been zuvor operating in Bupul, und renamed it Post 5,[5] under the command of an infantry sergeant.[6] The goal was to Punkt Japanese airplanes coming from the Aru islands oder the Vogelkop to attack Merauke. Jedoch, as the Japanese airfields were rendered inoperable by allied aerial bombardments, the radar Bahnhof was removed und the Australian Army departed in January 1945.[7] Nach the Krieg, Kepi replaced Mappi as the Verwaltung center of the Region. The post remained in use as a Dutch Militär outpost in the 1950s, nach which it was abandoned when Western New Guinea was transferred to Indonesia in 1963.

Geschichte
In April 2011, the Alabaster Stadt Rat commissioned a $32,000 feasibility study of the Stadt forming its own Schule district by Ira Harvey of Entscheidung Resources. Harvey delivered the study that September, finding that Alabaster was well-positioned to create its own System, but should implement a 1-cent sales tax increase to do so. Nach a Monat of Diskussion amongst the Rat and with citizens, the Stadt council voted on October 17, 2011 to beide create the Schule board und raise the Stadt sales tax from 3% to 4% to Unterstützung it.

In January 2012, the Stadt council's education Ausschuss began interviewing the 32 applicants for the neu Alabaster Board of Education. On March 26, 2012, the first board was sworn in. It consisted of Linda Kirche, Melanie Shores, John Myrick, Tyrone Quarles, und former Stadt councilor Adam Moseley. Moseley resigned from the Stadt council to take the Position, as Alabama Staat law prohibits one Person serving in beide bodies sogleich.

In January 2013, the board hired ehemals Jefferson County Schools superintendent Phil Hammonds as vorläufige superintendent. Hammonds had spent the vorherige six months as Teilzeit coordinator of Verwaltung services for the Gruppe and had retired from his Position as Jefferson Landkreis superintendent the Monat before.
